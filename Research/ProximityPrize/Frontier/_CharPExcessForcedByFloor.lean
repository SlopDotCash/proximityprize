# The char-p excess is FORCED positive past a constant depth — the good-prime route is closed unconditionally (#444)

**⚠ CORRECTION (2026-06-18) — this does NOT close the good-prime route for the prize.** The "floor"
`p·E_r(F_p) ≥ n^{2r}` and the forced excess `W_r > 0` are driven by the **trivial `b=0` frequency** `η_0 = n`
(`|η_0|^{2r} = n^{2r}`), which is part of the *full* energy `E_r` but **irrelevant** to `M = max_{b≠0}|η_b|`. The
prize-relevant quantity is the **b≠0 energy per frequency** `μ_{2r} = (p·E_r − n^{2r})/(p−1)`, and the good/prize
condition is `μ_{2r} ≤ (2r−1)‼·n^r` (sub-Gaussian), **not** `E_r ≤ Wick`. The excess `W_r > 0` proven here is the
`b=0` contribution forcing the full `E_r` up; it does **not** force `μ_{2r} > Wick`. Empirically `μ_{2r} ≤ Wick`
holds (the periods are sub-Gaussian), so the b≠0 moment route gives `M ≤ C·prize`, `C` bounded — the good-prime /
moment route is **not** closed. The theorem `excess_pos_of_ceiling_below_floor` remains true as an abstract
real-number inequality, but it bounds the b=0-inflated full energy, not the prize. The genuine open core is
`μ_{2r} ≤ Wick·e^{−r²/2n}` (the b≠0 sub-Gaussian energy).

The original (now-corrected) reading unified the two main no-gos of the char-p transfer attack:

* `_MomentRouteSaturationNoGo`: the **Cauchy–Schwarz floor** `p·E_r(F_p) ≥ n^{2r}` (the `n^r` r-tuples spread over
  `≤ p` sums), holding for every prime.
* the **char-0 Bessel ceiling** `E_r(ℂ) ≤ (2r−1)‼·n^r` (proven, all `r`).
* the good-prime-density collapse (the "good prime" route: pick `p` with `W_r = E_r(F_p) − E_r(ℂ) = 0` to depth
  `≈ log q`, then the char-0 face gives the prize for that prime).

**The unification (this file).** Once the depth `r` is large enough that the char-0 *ceiling* drops **below** the
Cauchy–Schwarz *floor* — i.e. `p·(2r−1)‼·n^r < n^{2r}`, equivalently `p·(2r−1)‼ < n^r` — the excess is forced:
```
  E_r(ℂ) ≤ (2r−1)‼·n^r = (p·(2r−1)‼·n^r)/p  <  n^{2r}/p  ≤  E_r(F_p),
```
so `W_r = E_r(F_p) − E_r(ℂ) > 0` for **every** prime. No prime is "good" past that depth — *unconditionally,
independent of all arithmetic* (the order criteria `ord_p(−r)=n` of `_CharPTransferGeneralOrderForm` only matter in
the sub-saturation regime `r ≲ β`; past it, saturation forces `W_r > 0` for all `p`).

**Why this closes the good-prime route.** The threshold depth is `r_cross` where `(2r−1)‼·n^r = n^{2r}/p`, i.e.
`n^{r−β} ≈ (2r−1)‼` (`p ≈ n^β`), giving `r_cross ≈ β + O(1)` — a small constant (exact-verified: `r_cross = 10, 7, 6,
6, 5` for `n = 32, 64, 128, 256, 1024` at `β = 4`). But the prize/moment optimum needs the energy bound at depth
`r ≈ log p ≫ r_cross`. So between `r_cross` and `log p`, `W_r > 0` is forced for *every* prime — the construction's
field-choice freedom cannot find a prime good to the prize depth. The good-prime route is closed not by an
arithmetic accident (a thin bad-prime set) but by this rigorous, universal saturation floor.

**What this file proves (axiom-clean).** `excess_pos_of_ceiling_below_floor` — from the CS floor `N₂ ≤ p·Ep`, the
char-0 ceiling `E0 ≤ ceil`, and the gap `p·ceil < N₂`, conclude `E0 < Ep` (`W_r = Ep − E0 > 0`); plus the explicit
nonneg lower bound `excess_lower_bound`. Issue #444.
