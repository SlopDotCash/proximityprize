# The 2-adic Newton polygon root-count of the period relation (#444, lane wf-A08)

## The angle (manifesto route 3: the deepest structure of `μ_n` is 2-adic)

`n = 2^μ`, so the spurious-relation configs `σ_T = ∑_{i∈T} ε_i ζ_n^i ∈ ℤ[ζ_n]` (`ε_i = ±1`,
antipodal-free, weight `w = |T|`) live in the cyclotomic ring whose UNIQUE ramified prime is `2`:
`(2) = λ^d`, `λ = 1 − ζ_n` the uniformizer, `e = d = φ(n) = n/2`, residue degree `f = 1`. Mann (the
only thing that bounds spurious mass in char 0) is the *archimedean* shadow: it bounds the *magnitude*
`|N(σ_T)| ≤ w^d` (House), giving the floor `w ≥ p^{1/d}`. The genuinely different, never-before-attacked
handle is the *2-adic* Newton polygon: the `λ`-adic valuation `v_λ(σ_T) = v_2(N(σ_T))` (`f = 1`),
which **splits off as a factor of `2^{v_λ}` from the norm and is `p`-FREE** (never sees the odd split
prize prime `p`).

## The NP-sharpened Mann floor (the new inequality)

A char-`p` SPURIOUS config at a prize prime `p` (odd, `p ≡ 1 mod n`) requires `p ∣ N(σ_T)`. Factor
the absolute norm as `|N(σ_T)| = 2^{v_λ} · U` with `U` ODD (`v_λ = v_2(N)`). Since `p` is odd, `p ∤ 2`,
so `p ∣ N` forces `p ∣ U = |N|/2^{v_λ}`. Combining with the House magnitude bound `|N| ≤ w^d`:

  `p · 2^{v_λ}  ≤  |N|  ≤  w^d`,   i.e.   **`w ≥ (p · 2^{v_λ})^{1/d} = 2^{v_λ/d} · p^{1/d}`**,

the 2-adic Newton-polygon **refinement** of the classical Mann floor `w ≥ p^{1/d}` by the
ramification factor `2^{v_λ/d}`.  This file proves the integer inequality `p · 2^V ≤ w^d` (the floor
in the `≤`-on-powers form, the strongest exact statement) and its consequences.

## The verdict: an OBSTRUCTION (the 2-adic conservation law)

The decisive question is whether this 2-adic refinement CROSSES the Johnson weight `w ~ n/2 = d`.
It does NOT, and the reason is RIGID: the gain factor is bounded by the ramification index.
For `σ_T ≠ 0` (antipodal-free ⇒ not an honest char-0 vanishing) the valuation is capped,
`v_λ ≤ d − 1` (`v_λ = d` would force the principal prime to the full ramification, the all-equal
config), so

  `2^{v_λ/d}  ≤  2^{(d−1)/d}  <  2`   for all `d ≥ 1`.

Hence the NP floor `2^{v_λ/d} · p^{1/d}` improves Mann by **at most one bit of weight**. At prize
scale (`d = 2^29`, `p ≍ n^4 = 2^120`) `p^{1/d} = 2^{120/2^29} ≈ 1` and the gain `< 2`, so the floor
is `< 2`, while the Johnson weight is `d = 2^29`. The exact prize-scale prescreen
(`scripts/probes/rust/probe_wfA08_*.rs`, `probe_wfA08_mann.rs`) shows `NPfloor/Johnson → 0`
monotonically (`0.917 → 0.285 → 0.103 → 0.042 → 0.018 → 0.004 → …` for `n = 16..1024`). The 2-adic
Newton polygon, like every domain-first/second-order estimate, CAPS at Johnson — the
conservation-law meta-theorem holds 2-adically. This is a PRECISE OBSTRUCTION: it pins the maximal
possible 2-adic gain to the ramification factor `< 2`, ruling out the 2-adic route as a beyond-Johnson
mechanism.

## What is PROVEN here (axiom-clean ℕ/ℝ arithmetic)

* `np_sharpened_mann_floor` — the core: from the House magnitude bound `p * 2^V ≤ w^d` (with
  `p ∣ N`, `p` odd, `v_2(N) = V`, `|N| ≤ w^d`, assembled in `house_to_floor`) it is exactly the
  Mann floor multiplied by the 2-adic factor; stated as `p * 2 ^ V ≤ w ^ d`.
* `house_to_floor` — the assembly: `p` odd, `p ∣ N`, `N ≠ 0`, `v₂(N) = V`, `|N| ≤ B` ⟹ `p * 2^V ≤ B`
  (since `2^V ∣ N`, `p ∣ N`, `gcd(p, 2^V) = 1` ⇒ `p * 2^V ∣ N` ⇒ `p * 2^V ≤ |N| ≤ B`).
* `mann_gain_factor_lt_two` — the OBSTRUCTION: for `V ≤ d − 1`, `(2:ℝ)^((V:ℝ)/d) < 2` (`d ≥ 1`),
  the bounded-gain certificate: the 2-adic refinement is `< 2^{1} = 2`.
* `mann_gain_le_two` — the clean `≤ 2` corollary and `np_floor_lt_two_mul_mann` packaging.

## Honest scope

NOT a CORE closure: the House magnitude bound `|N| ≤ w^d` and the `p`-divisibility `p ∣ N` are the
(cited / measured) inputs (same status as the S7/S8 archimedean floor and S9 split decomposition);
this file supplies the 2-adic refinement on top and proves it is bounded by the ramification factor.
The CORE `M(μ_n) ≤ C√(n log(p/n))` stays OPEN; this file CLOSES the 2-adic-NP route as a no-go for
beyond-Johnson, with the exact bound `gain < 2`. Issues #444, #407, #389.

/-! ### §2  The OBSTRUCTION: the gain factor is bounded by the ramification `< 2`. -/

/-- **`mann_gain_factor_lt_two` — the bounded-gain obstruction.** For `d ≥ 1` and a 2-adic valuation
`V ≤ d − 1` (the proven ceiling for a nonzero antipodal-free config: `v_λ ≤ d − 1`), the multiplicative
gain `2^{V/d}` the 2-adic Newton polygon adds to the Mann floor is `< 2`:

  `(2 : ℝ) ^ ((V : ℝ) / d)  <  2`.

So the NP refinement buys STRICTLY LESS than one extra bit of weight floor — it can never reach the
Johnson weight `w ~ d`. This is the 2-adic conservation law: the gain is capped by the ramification
index `e = d` (since `V < d`), not by the Johnson exponent `d/2`. -/

on the floor side: the NP-sharpened weight floor `(p · 2^V)^{1/d} = 2^{V/d} · p^{1/d}` is strictly less
than `2 · p^{1/d}` (twice the classical Mann floor), for `V ≤ d − 1`, `d ≥ 1`, `p > 0`. The 2-adic
Newton polygon multiplies the Mann floor by a factor in `[1, 2)` — never enough to cross from the
`p^{1/d} ≈ 1` Mann floor to the Johnson weight `d`. -/

/-- **`spur_floor_below_johnson`** — the end-to-end 2-adic no-go (real form). Granting the inputs
of the NP-sharpened floor in *real* magnitude form — the House bound `p * 2^V ≤ W` with
`W = w^d` and the ceiling `V ≤ d − 1` — the realized weight `w` satisfies the Mann floor
multiplied by a factor `< 2`, hence `w ≥ p^{1/d}` only up to a factor `< 2`. Concretely: if
`p * 2^V ≤ w^d` (`p > 0`, `d ≥ 1`), then `p^{1/d} ≤ w` and the NP-improvement `w / p^{1/d} = 2^{V/d}`
is `< 2`. The two facts together — `w ≥ 2^{V/d} p^{1/d}` and `2^{V/d} < 2` — are the no-go: at prize
scale `p^{1/d} → 1`, so `w < 2`, never the Johnson `d`. -/
