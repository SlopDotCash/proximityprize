# Contiguous-band words are list-decoding-benign (#444 — band dichotomy)

**Result (engine-verified, here proven axiom-clean for the representative families).** A received
word `X^a + γ·X^b` whose frequency support `{a, b} ∪ {0,…,k−1}` forms a **contiguous arc mod n**
agrees with a degree-`<k` codeword on **at most `k+1` points of `μ_n`** — i.e. only at the trivial
capacity+1 sliver. So contiguous-band words are NEVER list-decoding worst cases in the window
interior; the worst case must have **gapped** (non-contiguous) frequency support, and it is the gap
that engages the cyclotomic / BGK char-sum structure.

This **corrects** the prior campaign claim that the consecutive lacunary `x^{n-1}+x^{n-2}` is the
worst-case window word: the engine (`scripts/rust-pg`, cross-checked) shows its list is `0`
throughout the window except the single capacity+1 level, exactly as the bound below predicts. The
genuine worst words (gapped support) are the open core.

**Mechanism (elementary — no Beukers–Smyth needed).** On `μ_n` (where `x^n = 1`, so `x ≠ 0`),
a root of the agreement function forces a root of a fixed degree-`≤(k+1)` polynomial obtained by a
monomial (unit) multiplication. This is the unconditional **contiguous special case** of the open
`SparseRaggedExcessBound` lever (`_RThinSparseRealizability.lean`).

* `card_roots_le_of_imp` — the principle: if `f`-roots in `S` are `g`-roots for a fixed nonzero
  `g` of degree `≤ m`, then `f` has `≤ m` roots in `S`.
* `consecutiveTop_agreement_le` — `X^{n-1}+γ·X^{n-2}` agrees with any degree-`<k` codeword on
  `≤ k+1` points of `μ_n` (witness `g = X + Cγ − X²·c`, root-forcing via `x²·f = g` on `μ_n`).
* `literalArc_agreement_le` — no-wrap version: support in a literal range `Icc s (s+m)` ⇒ `≤ m`
  nonzero roots (e.g. `X^k + γ·X^{k+1}`), via `X^s ∣ f`.

All axiom-clean. Issue #444. Honesty: this bounds the EASY (contiguous) family; the hard (gapped)
family remains the open core / BGK wall — see `SparseRaggedExcessBound`.

/-- **Top-gap span bound (generalizes `consecutiveTop`).** The word `X^{n−1} + γ·X^{n−j}`
(`2 ≤ j ≤ n`, `k ≥ 1`) agrees with any degree-`<k` codeword on at most `k + j − 1` points of `μ_n`.
The "reach" past capacity is governed by the gap `j` between the two frequencies: reaching the floor
edge (agreement `k + Θ(n/log n)`) requires `j = Ω(n/log n)` — i.e. the two frequencies must be far
apart, a genuinely **spread/lacunary** word, where this elementary degree bound is vacuous and the
true bound is the BGK / `Z_{2^μ}` uncertainty wall. So the provable/open boundary is exactly the
support span. Witness `g = X^{j−1} + Cγ − X^j·c` (degree `≤ k+j−1`, `coeff (j−1) = 1`). -/
