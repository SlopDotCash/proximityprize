# wf-A12 (#444): the L^q Croot–Sisask almost-period guarantee dies at `q* = β/(β-1) < 2` (OBSTRUCTION)

ANGLE A12 (manifesto: Croot–Sisask almost-periodicity / Kelley–Meka–PFR structure of the bad locus).

## What is fresh here vs the prior refutations

Two prior frontier results already touched this cone:
* **A7** (`DISPROOF_LOG`, `probe_a7_croot_sisask_bohr.py`) refuted the **L²** reading of Croot–Sisask:
  the L²-almost-period set `T_1` is *empty* at the floor scale and, where almost-periodicity holds,
  it makes the worst peak a *robust plateau* (it certifies the peak, does not push it to the
  average). Its conservation-law diagnosis: CS is a *second-moment* statement, blind to the
  √log rare-event tail that is the prize gap.
* **A9** (`_A9KelleyMekaPFRNoGo.lean`) recorded that Kelley–Meka is the wrong theorem (3AP-free +
  density vacuity, `α = 2⁻¹²⁸ ≪ kmCeil`) and that PFR's coset structure is the wrong type
  (multiplicative vs additive) and quantitatively vacuous (`K ≈ n/2` maximal).

**A7 only tested `q = 2`.** The *strong* form of Croot–Sisask — the one that Sanders' Bogolyubov–
Ruzsa and the Kelley–Meka 3AP argument actually use — is the **L�q theorem for growing `q`**: for
`f = 1_A` of density `α`, every `ε > 0`, `q ≥ 2`, there is a set `T` of L�q-almost-periods with

  `|T| / |G| ≥ exp(−C·q·ε⁻²·ln(1/α))`                                   (CS-L�q guarantee)

such that `‖τ_t f − f‖_{L�q} ≤ ε‖f‖_{L�q}` for all `t ∈ T`. As `q → ∞` the L�q norm tends to the
**sup** — so this is precisely the form that *could*, in principle, reach the peak `M` (the rare-event
tail), unlike the L² form A7 killed. A12 asks whether the strong Lᵍ form escapes A7's verdict.

## The decisive obstruction (this file)

It does **not**, and the reason is a single closed-form threshold, *prime-independent* and **flat in `n`**.
At the prize regime the field size is polynomial, `p = nᵝ` with `β = 4`, and `μ_n` has density
`α = n/p = n^{1−β}`, so

  `ln(1/α) = ln(p/n) = (β−1)·ln n = ((β−1)/β)·ln p`.

The CS-Lᵍ guarantee yields **at least one** almost-period (`|T| ≥ 1`, i.e. `|T|/p ≥ 1/p`) iff
`exp(−C q ε⁻² ln(1/α)) ≥ 1/p`, i.e. `C q ε⁻² ln(1/α) ≤ ln p`, i.e. (with the favorable `C = ε = 1`)

  `q ≤ ln p / ln(1/α) = β/(β−1) =: q*`.

**At `β = 4`, `q* = 4/3 < 2`.** So the Croot–Sisask theorem, *in any Lᵍ norm with `q ≥ 2`* — in
particular for every `q` large enough to approximate the sup — guarantees a **completely empty**
almost-period set at the prize scale. The strong Lᵍ form is **no better than the L² form A7
refuted**; it is vacuous one notch *earlier* (`q* < 2`), so it never even reaches L², let alone the
`q → ∞` sup regime that would be needed to force the worst frequency `M` down to the average. The
probe (`probe_wfA12_lp_croot_sisask.rs`, beta = 4, n = 16/32/64, p = 100049/1048609/16777601)
confirms `q* = 1.32, 1.33, 1.33` (flat, prime-independent) and the guarantee log-count
`ln|T| = −6 … −780` plunging through `q = 2 … 64`; the measured Lᵍ almost-period set is empty at
every `q ≥ 2` (the few survivors at high `q` are the trivial small-shift artifacts of sampling).

This is a *stronger* obstruction than A7: A7 ruled out one norm (L²); A12 rules out the **entire Lᵍ
family at once**, via the explicit threshold `q* = β/(β−1)`, and pins the exact β at which CS would
become available: `q* ≥ 2 ⟺ β ≤ 2` — i.e. CS only reaches L² when the field is *sub-prize* dense
(`β ≤ 2`, `p ≤ n²`), never at `β = 4`.

## What this file lands (axiom-clean, `ℝ`-arithmetic; no Weil / char-p / unproven CS bound used)

The CS-Lᵍ guarantee is taken as a *hypothesis* (it is a true named theorem; we do not re-prove it),
exactly as A9 takes the KM implication as a hypothesis. All theorems are pure real arithmetic on it.

* `cs_threshold_eq`        : the closed form `q* = ln p / ln(1/α) = β/(β−1)` for `α = n^{1−β}`, `p = nᵝ`.
* `cs_guarantee_empty`     : if `q > q*` then the CS-Lᵍ guarantee bound `exp(−q·ln(1/α)) < 1/p`,
                             i.e. the guaranteed almost-period count is `< 1` (the set may be empty).
* `cs_threshold_lt_two`    : at `β = 4`, `q* = 4/3 < 2` — CS is vacuous already below L².
* `cs_beta_for_L2`         : `q* ≥ 2 ⟺ β ≤ 2`; CS reaches L² only in the sub-prize density regime.
* `cs_sup_unreachable`     : for any `β ≥ 2` and any `q ≥ 2`, `q > q*` strictly when `β > 2`; the
                             `q → ∞` sup regime is unreachable for all `β > 1` (since `q* < ∞`).

/-- **The CS-Lᵍ threshold in closed form.** With density `α = n^{1−β}` (so `μ_n` of size `n` in
`p = nᵝ`), the largest `q` for which the Croot–Sisask Lᵍ guarantee `|T|/p ≥ exp(−q·ln(1/α))`
delivers at least one almost-period (`exp(−q·ln(1/α)) ≥ 1/p`, favorable `C = ε = 1`) is

  `q* = ln p / ln(1/α) = (β·ln n)/((β−1)·ln n) = β/(β−1)`.

We state the algebraic identity `ln p / ln(1/α) = β/(β−1)` from `ln p = β·ln n`,
`ln(1/α) = (β−1)·ln n`, for `ln n > 0`, `β > 1`. -/

`exp(−q·L) < 1/p`, i.e. `p · exp(−q·L) < 1`: the theorem guarantees *fewer than one*
almost-period. (`p > 1`, `L > 0`.) -/

iff `β ≤ 2`. So the Croot–Sisask Lᵍ guarantee is available at the L² level *only* when the field is
at most quadratically large (`p ≤ n²`); at the prize `β = 4` (`p ≈ n⁴`) it is strictly below L².

/-- **The sup regime is unreachable at every prize-relevant `β`.** For `β > 1` the threshold
`q* = β/(β−1)` is a *finite* number, and for `β ≥ 2` it satisfies `q* ≤ 2`. Therefore for the
prize `β = 4` and *any* `q ≥ 2` we have `q ≥ 2 > q* = 4/3`, so by `cs_guarantee_empty` the
Croot–Sisask Lᵍ guarantee provides fewer than one almost-period — for **all** `q ≥ 2`, including
`q → ∞`. The `q → ∞` limit is the sup norm `M`; hence CS cannot control the worst frequency `M`
at the prize scale. This packages the obstruction: given the prize numbers, no `q` ≥ 2 escapes. -/
