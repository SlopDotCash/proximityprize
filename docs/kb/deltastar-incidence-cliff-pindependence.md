# δ* p-independence via the incidence CLIFF — and the precise B5 answer (#407)

**Status: genuine structural finding, n=16 full + n=32/64 cliff confirmed across primes; NOT a closure but a
strong reduction; the remaining open piece is COMBINATORIAL (not BGK).**

## STRENGTHENED RESULT (n=8,16,32,64, multiple primes): δ* is ROBUSTLY p-independent — it decouples from BGK

Scaling of the two sides of the cliff (k=2, `probe_407_cliff_gap_scaling.py`, 2 primes each):

| n | over-det `I(s=k+2)` | p-indep? | closed form | under-det `I(s=k+1)` | p-indep? |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 8 | [9,9] | YES | (n/2−1)²=9 | [25,25] | yes (small n) |
| 16 | [49,49] | YES | 49 | [401,401] | yes (small n) |
| 32 | [225,225] | YES | 225 | [4225,**4257**] | **NO** |
| 64 | [961,961] | YES | (31)²=961 | [34881,**37569**] | **NO** |

- The **over-determined** incidence (`s−k ≥ 2`) is **p-INDEPENDENT** with the clean closed form `(n/2−1)²` (k=2).
- The **under-determined** incidence (`s−k ≤ 1`) is **p-DEPENDENT** (differs across primes from n=32 up) and is
  `~Θ(C(n,k+1))`.

**The robust argument that δ* is p-INDEPENDENT (general k):**
`δ* = (n − s*)/n`, `s* = min{s : I(s) ≤ budget}`, budget `= q·ε* ≈ n`. Since `I(s)` decreases in s:
1. The largest under-determined witness size is `s=k+1`, with `I(k+1) ~ Θ(C(n,k+1)) ≫ n = budget` for **every**
   prime (C(n,k+1) vastly exceeds n). So `s=k+1` is uniformly "bad" (I>budget) across all primes ⟹ `s* > k+1` ⟹
   **`s* ≥ k+2`: the binding is ALWAYS in the over-determined regime.**
2. `I(s*)` (over-determined) is **p-INDEPENDENT** ⟹ the "good" side of the threshold is p-independent.
3. The "bad" side just below (`s*−1`) is either over-determined (p-indep) or the `s=k+1` boundary (p-dependent
   but uniformly `≫ budget`). Either way it is uniformly bad across primes.

⟹ **`δ*` is p-INDEPENDENT.** The under-determined p-dependence (the char-p / additive-energy content) lives at
`I ~ Θ(C(n,k+1)) ≫ budget`, far on the bad side, and **never reaches the threshold**. The binding is blocked
into the over-determined (p-independent) regime by the sheer size of the under-determined count.

**Why the over-determined regime is p-independent (structural, likely provable):** `s−k ≥ 2` means each witness
imposes ≥2 conditions on the single unknown γ, so a γ exists only when those conditions are *dependent* — an
algebraic coincidence among the `n`-th roots of unity. Such coincidences are **char-0 / integral** (vanishing
sums of roots of unity, Lam–Leung/Mann type) and reduce mod any large `p≡1 (mod n)` to the same count. The
under-determined regime (≤1 condition) gives a generic γ per witness whose *value* depends on `p`, so its
dedup count is p-dependent.

## Consequence: the prize is a COMBINATORIAL problem, off the BGK wall

`δ*` decouples from the open, p-dependent BGK character-sum max `max_b|η_b|`. It is pinned by the
**over-determined far-line incidence threshold** — a p-INDEPENDENT, combinatorial (roots-of-unity coincidence)
count. So the `δ* = BGK` reduction is genuinely LOSSY, and the prize reduces to:

> **Compute the large-n asymptotics of the over-determined far-line incidence threshold** `s*(n,k)` (where the
> p-independent over-determined incidence crosses budget `~n`), and check whether `δ* = (n−s*)/n` equals the
> floor `1−ρ−Θ(1/log n)`.

This is a **counting / roots-of-unity-coincidence** problem (Lam–Leung / cyclotomic), NOT the analytic BGK
square-root-cancellation wall.

## Remaining open (honest)
1. **Prove the over-determined incidence is p-independent** (the algebraic-coincidence = char-0 claim). Very
   plausibly provable via vanishing-sums-of-roots-of-unity (Lam–Leung) — this is the key lemma to formalize.
2. **Compute the over-determined threshold asymptotics** and compare to the floor (the new, combinatorial core).
3. Confirm the exact budget normalization (`q·ε* ≈ n`) and that the over-direction MAX of the over-determined
   incidence is itself p-independent (it is, being a max of p-independent per-direction values).
4. The under-sampled-directions caveat for the exact δ* value at each n remains (the army's full-direction job),
   but it does NOT affect the p-INDEPENDENCE conclusion (max of p-indep values is p-indep).

## Lean substrate now landed for the affine gate

`Research/ProximityPrize/Frontier/_BindingRadiusAffineFiber.lean` formalizes the finite-field
counting shell used by the cliff route:

- `affineConstraint_eq_neg_div`: a non-heavy affine slot pins the scalar `γ = -A/B`;
- `ratio_eq_of_two_affine_constraints`: two non-heavy slots on the same scalar force equal pinned ratios;
- `badScalar_card_le_activeWitnesses`: bad scalars inject into active witnesses once a moving slot is chosen;
- `badScalar_card_le_pairConsistentWitnesses`: in a fixed two-slot over-determined slice, bad scalars inject into
  the ratio-consistency locus.

This is **not** a proof of δ*.  It cleanly isolates the next real obligation: identify the correct cyclotomic
two-slot witnesses and count the ratio-consistency locus / p-independent coincidence family.

**Status: genuine structural finding, n=16 full + n=32/64 cliff confirmed; NOT a closure; one caveat + the large-n question open.**

## The mechanism: an incidence cliff at the over/under-determined boundary

The exact far-line incidence `I(a,b;r)` (number of γ with the line `x^a+γx^b` within distance r of RS[μ_n,k])
has a sharp CLIFF as a function of the witness size `s = n−r` relative to `k`:

| regime | conditions on γ per witness | incidence | p-dependence |
|---|---|---|---|
| **over-determined** `s−k ≥ 2` | ≥2 (over-constrained) | `O(1)`–small (structured) | **p-INDEPENDENT** |
| **critically/under-determined** `s−k ≤ 1` | ≤1 | `Θ(C(n,s)) ~ Θ(q)` (saturated) | **p-DEPENDENT** |

Verified at n=32, k=4 (ρ=1/8), 3 primes p∈{200003,500009,1000003}:
- `s=6` (s−k=2, over-determined): maxI = **[1, 1, 1]** — p-independent.
- `s=5` (s−k=1, under-determined): maxI = **[125408, 163872, 179872]** — p-DEPENDENT, ~0.6q.

The incidence jumps from `O(1)` to `~10^5` across one step in s. (n=16 analog: over-determined s=6 gave 89,
p-independent; the cliff is the same.)

## Why δ* is p-INDEPENDENT even though the count is p-DEPENDENT (the key subtlety)

`δ* = sup{δ : maxI(⌊δn⌋) ≤ budget}`, budget `= q·ε* ~ n`. δ* is a THRESHOLD, not the count. p-independence of
δ* requires only that `sign(I(r) − budget)` is the same across primes at each r — NOT that I(r) itself is
p-independent. Because the prize **budget ~n falls in the cliff GAP** (`O(1) ≪ n ≪ Θ(q)`):
- at the over-determined radius, `I = O(1) ≤ budget` for ALL primes (uniformly good);
- at the under-determined radius, `I = Θ(q) > budget` for ALL primes (uniformly bad, despite differing counts).

So **δ* is pinned p-independently by the cliff location**, even though the under-determined count carries char-p
info. The cliff does the work the BGK char-sum max was thought to do.

## The precise answer to dossier B5 ("CensusDomination = E(μ_n) 2nd-order, or deep?")

Both lanes are real and DIFFERENT, reconciled by the cliff:
- The **count** (CensusDomination / under-determined incidence) is **p-DEPENDENT** — it is NOT a purely
  combinatorial 2nd-order object; it carries the char-p / additive-energy information (consistent with it being
  Shkredov's E(μ_n) at the count level).
- The **threshold δ*** (the prize quantity) is **p-INDEPENDENT** — it decouples from the p-dependent count (and
  hence from the BGK char-sum max) because the budget sits in the incidence cliff gap.
So the `δ* = BGK` reduction IS lossy (as the in-tree loss-web marks `I→M` √-lossy): δ* is the cliff location,
a combinatorial quantity, NOT the p-dependent BGK period max.

## Caveats / what stays open (no overclaim)

1. **Under-sampled directions at n=32:** the over-determined maxI=[1,1,1] used only 4 monomial directions. The
   TRUE max over all far directions at the over-determined radius could be larger; if it straddles the budget
   across primes, δ* could become p-dependent there. Needs the full-direction search (the decoupling army's job).
2. **Large-n cliff-vs-budget:** does the budget ~n ALWAYS fall in the cliff gap as n→2^30? The gap is
   `[O(1), Θ(C(n,k+1))]`; `C(n,k+1) ≫ n` for the prize, so the gap is wide — but the exact over-determined
   incidence growth vs n must be mapped to be sure the binding stays over-determined (p-indep) and never lands
   exactly at the cliff edge (where p-dependence could enter). This is the precise form of the ">2^12 crossover".
3. If the binding ever lands AT the cliff edge (`s−k=1` exactly with I straddling budget across primes), δ*
   becomes p-dependent and reduces to the wall there.

**Net:** δ* p-independence is REAL and now has a mechanism (the incidence cliff with budget-in-the-gap), giving
a precise B5 answer (count p-dependent, threshold p-independent). The remaining open piece is whether the binding
stays strictly inside the over-determined regime for all prize n — a sharp, checkable question, not the diffuse
BGK wall. Probe: `probe_407_n32_incidence_cliff.py`.
