# Rewinding knowledge soundness for the toy IOR: kernel-dependency audit & usage

This module sits *downstream* of the toy-problem spec files and serves two purposes:

1. **Kernel-dependency audit.** It re-checks (via `#print axioms`) that the rewinding-extractor content — the
   2×2 solve `toySolve`, its correctness `toySolve_combine`, the 2-special-soundness theorem
   `toyRewindingExtractor_twoSpecialSound`, and the fully-proven framework witness
   `protocol62_knowledgeSoundnessViaRewinding` — depends on **no** `sorry` and **no** project-level
   assumed constant (only Lean's standard `propext`/`Classical.choice`/`Quot.sound`).

2. **Usage demonstration.** It shows the proven rewinding witness driving the framework's
   operational guarantee `Extractor.knowledgeSoundnessViaRewinding.extracts`: whenever a malicious
   prover beats the 2-special-sound knowledge error `1/|F|` at a recorded prefix, a witness in the
   relaxed relation `R̃²_{C,δ}` is extractable — *for free* from the proven 2-special-soundness, no
   re-derivation.

## Where the actual content lives

The concrete rewinding extractor for ABF26 Construction 6.2 / 6.9 and the reductions of the three
knowledge-soundness holes to their named bridge residuals live in the owned spec files:

* `ArkLib/ProofSystem/ToyProblem/Spec/General.lean` —
  `toyCombine`, `toySolve`, `toySolve_combine`, `toyRewindingExtractor`, `toyAccepts`,
  `toyRewindingExtractor_twoSpecialSound`, `protocol62_knowledgeSoundnessViaRewinding`, and the
  bridge-reduced `protocol62_knowledgeSound` (L6.6) / `protocol62_rbrKnowledgeSound` (L6.8).
* `ArkLib/ProofSystem/ToyProblem/Spec/SimplifiedIOR.lean` —
  the bridge-reduced `simplifiedIOR_knowledgeSound` (L6.10).

The abstract framework consumed by all of the above is
`ArkLib/ToMathlib/RewindingExtractor.lean`.

/-- **Operational extraction guarantee for the toy IOR (proven).** A malicious prover that, at a
recorded prefix `pre`, beats the 2-special-sound knowledge error `1/|F|` over fresh combination
randomness `γ` yields an extractable witness in the relaxed relation `R̃²_{C,δ}`.

This is the framework's `knowledgeSoundnessViaRewinding.extracts` instantiated at the *proven* toy
witness `protocol62_knowledgeSoundnessViaRewinding`. It demonstrates the rewinding predicate is
usable end-to-end, not an inert interface: the witness is produced with no `sorry` and no
project-level assumed constant beyond Lean's standard kernel dependencies. -/

/-! ## Kernel-dependency audit

Each `#print axioms` below must report only Lean's standard kernel axioms
(`propext`, `Classical.choice`, `Quot.sound`) — i.e. **no** `sorryAx` and **no** project-level
assumed constant in the rewinding-extractor content or the framework witness. -/
