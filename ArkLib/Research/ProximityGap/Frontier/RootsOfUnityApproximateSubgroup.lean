# The BGK multiplicative input, Mathlib-interoperable: `μ_n` is an `IsApproximateSubgroup 1` of `Fˣ` (#444)

`BGKMultiplicativeInput.lean` lands the multiplicative half of the BGK 2006 sum–product chain for the
in-tree carrier `μ_n = RepCountCurve.muN F n`, but it states the doubling constant `σₘ[μ_n] = 1`
**by hand** (`muN_doubling_eq_one`) because its docstring observes that "the `Combinatorics.Additive`
`Finset.mulConst` requires the ambient type to be a `Group`, which a field `F` is not under `*`; the
in-tree carrier lives in `F`, so we state the constant directly." That hand-statement is correct but
it leaves `μ_n` **outside** Mathlib's `IsApproximateSubgroup` API — exactly the API the BGK route
needs to compose with a (future) sum–product estimate.

This file closes that interoperability gap by lifting to the group of units `Fˣ`, where the canonical
Mathlib object `rootsOfUnity n F : Subgroup Fˣ` lives. The bridge is `Mathlib`'s own
`IsApproximateSubgroup.subgroup : IsApproximateSubgroup 1 (H : Set G)` for a `SubgroupClass`, which we
specialise to the roots of unity and then weld back to the in-tree `μ_n` via the units-coercion image.

## What is welded (NON-MOMENT, sign-free, EXTEND-proven on Mathlib's approximate-subgroup API)

* `rootsOfUnity_isApproximateSubgroup` — `IsApproximateSubgroup (1 : ℝ) (↑(rootsOfUnity n F))`: the
  `n`-th roots of unity, as a subgroup of `Fˣ`, are an approximate subgroup with the **optimal**
  constant `K = 1` (a genuine subgroup, not merely approximate). This is the BGK multiplicative input
  living in Mathlib's actual `IsApproximateSubgroup` type, so it now composes with `card_pow_le`,
  `card_mul_self_le`, `IsApproximateSubgroup.image`, etc.
* `rootsOfUnity_card_pow_le` — `#((rootsOfUnity n F : Finset Fˣ) ^ k) ≤ #(rootsOfUnity n F)`: the
  `K = 1` specialisation of `IsApproximateSubgroup.card_pow_le`, i.e. **every** power set has cardinality
  at most the subgroup's — the exact `σₘ = 1` doubling at all orders, now machine-derived from the
  Mathlib API rather than restated.
* `rootsOfUnity_card_mul_self_le` — `#(R * R) ≤ #R`: the second-order doubling consequence.
* `coe_rootsOfUnity_image_eq_muN` — the WELD to the in-tree carrier: for `n ≥ 1`,
  `(Units.val '' (rootsOfUnity n F : Set Fˣ)) = (muN F n : Set F)`. The Mathlib subgroup object and
  the in-tree `μ_n` Finset are the same set under the units coercion, so the approximate-subgroup
  structure proven above transports to `BGKMultiplicativeInput`'s carrier.

## Why this matters (honest scope)

This is still the **easy** (multiplicative) half of the BGK dichotomy — trivial because `μ_n` is
literally a subgroup, so `K = 1`. The value added over `BGKMultiplicativeInput` is purely structural
plumbing: the in-tree `μ_n` is now connected to Mathlib's `IsApproximateSubgroup` type with the
optimal constant, which is the precondition for ever composing it with a formalised sum–product /
Plünnecke–Ruzsa estimate. The genuinely hard, multi-month half — deriving a contradiction from
`σₘ = 1` together with large additive energy `E^+(μ_n) ≫ n^{5/2}` — is **untouched**: Mathlib still has
no sum–product theorem over `𝔽_p`. No char-`p` transfer, no capacity, no beyond-Johnson `√(log)`
saving, no growth-law, nothing about the cliff-at-`n/2`. The multiplicative doubling is field- and
thickness-BLIND (a subgroup is a subgroup in any field, thin or thick) — so by the §3 meta-thm and
rule 3 it is **not** thinness-essential and CANNOT prove CORE; it is the sign-free shadow whose
contrast with additive Sidon-ness is the *configuration* of the wall, not a route around it.

`CORE M(μ_n) ≤ C·√(n·log(q/n))` with absolute `C` remains **OPEN**.
