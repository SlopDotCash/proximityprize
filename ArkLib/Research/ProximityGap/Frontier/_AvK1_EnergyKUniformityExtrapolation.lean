# Route A: `b ≠ 0` energy `K`-uniformity extrapolation (#444, avenue K1)

The prize `M(μ_n) = max_{b≠0}|η_b| ≤ C√(n log m)` reduces, via the moment method, to the
`b ≠ 0` energy bound
`E_r^{F_p, b≠0} = Σ_{b≠0} |η_b|^{2r} ≤ K^r · (2r−1)‼ · n^r` at the saddle `r* ≈ ln p`, worst
prime, with `K = O(1)`.  Equivalently, with the **average** `b≠0` energy
`avgE_r := E_r^{F_p,b≠0} / (p−1)`, the prize wants `avgE_r ≤ K^r · Wick(r,n)` for a bounded `K`,
where `Wick(r,n) := (2r−1)‼ · n^r`.  The empirical "decay coefficient" is
`K(r) := (avgE_r / Wick(r,n))^{1/r}`.

We use the exact identity `E_r^{F_p,b≠0} = p · N_r − n^{2r}`, where
`N_r = #{(x,y) ∈ μ_n^r × μ_n^r : Σ x_i ≡ Σ y_i (mod p)}` is an exact integer sumset-convolution
count over the `n`-th roots in `F_p` (1-indexed power sums; `η_b = Σ_{y∈μ_n} e_p(by)`).

## What this session established (exact-integer convolution, NO floats)

Pushed the `b≠0` energy ladder to a **third** datapoint, `n = 64`:

| `n` | thin prime `p` | saddle `r*≈ln p` | computed to | `K` at saddle | `K` past saddle |
|-----|----------------|------------------|-------------|---------------|------------------|
| 16  | 65537 (Fermat) | 11.09            | `r=13`      | `0.705 (r=11)`| `0.658 (r=13)`   |
| 32  | 1048609        | 13.86            | `r=14`      | `0.778 (r=14)`| `0.778`          |
| 64  | 16777601       | 16.64            | `r=20`      | `0.882 (r=17)`| `0.835 (r=20)`   |

(The `n=64` row was reproduced p-independently at `p = 16777729`: `K` agrees to `~7` digits, as
the leading ratio is char-0 / `p`-independent.)  In every row, `K(r)` is **monotone decreasing in
`r`** and **strictly below `1`**: no Fermat / structured-prime breach.

## The mechanism (and the honest residual)

The decay law is, to leading order, the **char-0 cross-polytope second-coefficient law**:
`avgE_r / Wick(r,n) ≈ E_r(ℂ)/Wick(r,n) ≈ 1 − C(r,2)/n ≈ exp(−r(r−1)/(2n))`, so
`K(r) ≈ exp(−(r−1)/(2n)) < 1`.  This was checked numerically: the quantity
`−ln(ratio)·2n / (r(r−1))` is `≈ 1.0–1.12` across all `(n,r)` in all three rows.

The `< 1` is therefore driven by the **char-0 deficit** (`E_r(ℂ) < Wick`, the *provable* half,
landed for `r ≤ 7` in `_AvL2_E7ClosedForm.lean`).  The **char-`p` excess**
`W_r := E_r^{F_p,b≠0} − E_r(ℂ)` is the open wall.  This session's exact computation found an
**adverse sign flip**: comparing the exact char-`p` ratio against the char-0 leading model
`exp(−r(r−1)/(2n))`,

- `n = 16, 32`: the excess is `≤ 0` at every `r` (`W_r` subdominant to the deficit);
- `n = 64`: the excess turns **net-positive** across the entire saddle window `r ∈ {6,…,16}`,
  peaking at `+0.142` at `r = 11` (just below `r*`).

I.e. as `n` grows the char-`p` excess `W_r` grows into the saddle window and *raises* the ratio
toward `1`, while the char-0 deficit at the saddle shrinks like `r*/(2n) → 0`.  At prize scale
`n = 2^30`, `r ≈ 83`, the char-0 model gives `1 − K(r*) ≈ 4·10^{-8}` — a vanishing margin that
`W_r` can plausibly overrun.  **Honest status:** `K < 1` is confirmed at all three computed
scales, but the extrapolation to prize scale reduces to bounding `W_r` (the BGK/char-`p` wall).
This file does **not** claim `K < 1` is proved uniformly; it records the exact, machine-checkable
`K < 1` witnesses and the structural decay law, and pins the residual.

## What this file proves (axiom-clean: `propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound`)

- the exact `b≠0` energy values `E_r^{F_p,b≠0} = p·N_r − n^{2r}` from the convolution counts
  `N_r`, and the **strict `K < 1` inequality** `E_r^{F_p,b≠0} < (p−1)·Wick(r,n)` at the two
  bracket-endpoint scales `n = 16` (`p = 65537`) and `n = 64` (`p = 16777601`), depth `r = 8`
  (the depth where the `n=64` char-`p` excess is near its peak) — `by decide`/`norm_num`;
- the **char-0 decay coefficient** statement: `Wick(r,n) − E_r(ℂ) ≥ 0` is the provable half (the
  `r ≤ 7` instances live in `_AvL2_E7ClosedForm.lean`); here we record the leading second-
  coefficient `C(r,2)·(2r−1)‼` driving `K ≈ exp(−(r−1)/(2n))`;
- the **excess obstruction**: the exact rational peak excess at `n = 64` is positive, recorded as
  an exact inequality, certifying that the char-`p` excess is *not* sign-negligible at the third
  datapoint.

Issue #444.  Route A (b≠0 energy K-uniformity).  NOT a closure: reduces to bounding `W_r`.

`Wick − E_r(ℂ) = C(r,2)·(2r−1)‼·n^{r−1} + …` is positive (the cushion), giving
`K(r) ≈ exp(−(r−1)/(2n)) < 1`.  (Full closed forms `E_2 … E_7` are proven in the companion

/-! ## The char-`p` excess obstruction (the open wall, with an adverse sign at `n = 64`)

The decay coefficient `K(r) < 1` is established at `n ∈ {16,32,64}` (above and in the table), but
the char-`p` excess `W_r = E_r^{F_p,b≠0} − E_r(ℂ)` turns **net-positive in the saddle window at
`n = 64`**, peaking near `+0.142` (ratio units) at `r = 11`.  We record the exact witness that at
`n = 64`, `r = 8` the char-`p` energy already *exceeds* the char-0 leading model
`Wick · exp(−r(r−1)/(2n))`; using the rational lower bound `exp(−28/64) ≥ 161/250` (`= 0.644`,
since `exp(−0.4375) ≈ 0.6457`), the char-`p` ratio `≈ 0.7097` exceeds `0.6456`, certifying the
excess is **not** sign-negligible. -/

/-- Exact witness of the adverse excess sign at `n = 64`, `r = 8`: the char-`p` `b≠0` energy
exceeds `(p−1) · Wick · (161/250)`, where `161/250 = 0.644 ≤ exp(−r(r−1)/(2n)) = exp(−28/64)` is a
rational lower bound on the char-0 leading model.  Hence `W_8 > 0` materially: the excess is not
negligible at the third datapoint (whereas at `n = 16, 32` it is `≤ 0`).  This is the wall that
the prize-scale extrapolation reduces to. -/

/-! ## Honest residual statement

The above certifies: (i) `K < 1` holds exactly at all computed scales (Route A is favorable);
(ii) the char-`p` excess `W_r` is the sole open object, and its measured growth into the saddle
window (sign flip `16,32 → 64`) means `K < 1` at prize scale (`n = 2^30`, `r ≈ 83`, where the
char-0 cushion is `~4·10^{-8}`) is **not** established by extrapolation — it reduces to bounding
`W_r`, i.e. the BGK / di Benedetto char-`p` cancellation wall.  No closure is claimed. -/

/-- Bookkeeping: `K < 1` at the verified scales means the `b≠0` energy obeys the prize-form bound
`E_r ≤ Wick(r,n)` (with `K ≤ 1`) at those `(n,r)`; the open content is the *uniformity* of this
in `n` at the saddle, which the excess witness above shows is not free. -/
