# Malicious-prover seam decomposition for sequential composition (issue #13 / #25)

The soundness composition theorem `Verifier.append_soundness` (in `Append.lean`) is residual-gated
on `appendSoundnessResidual`. Its stated obstruction: soundness quantifies over an arbitrary
malicious prover `P` over `pSpec₁ ++ₚ pSpec₂`, so the proof must decompose `P` at the seam round `m`
into a `pSpec₁`-phase malicious prover (running rounds `0` to `m-1`, with `P`'s round-`m` output
context as its `output`) and a `pSpec₂`-phase malicious prover (resuming from that context). No
analogue of the honest `Prover.append` existed in the codebase yet.

This file supplies that missing construction: `Prover.fst` (the left half) and `Prover.snd` (the
right half). They are the inverse of the honest `Prover.append`: where `Prover.append` glues two
provers into one over the appended protocol, `fst` and `snd` split an arbitrary prover over the
appended protocol back into its two phases, carrying `P`'s seam state (its `PrvState` at the last
`pSpec₁` round) across the cut.

- `Prover.fst P` runs rounds `0` to `m-1` exactly as `P`, then outputs the seam state.
- `Prover.snd P` resumes from the seam state (passed in as the input statement) and runs rounds `m`
  to `m+n-1` exactly as `P`, ending with `P`'s own output.

The constructions reuse the left/right-half transport lemmas (`append_dir_castLE`, `append_dir_natAdd`,
`append_Message_castLE`, `append_Message_natAdd`, `append_Challenge_natAdd`) proven in `Append.lean`.
Each round of a restriction lies wholly in one half of the appended protocol, so, unlike
`Prover.append` (which case-splits on `i < m`, `i = m`, `i > m`), no per-round case analysis is needed.

These are axiom-clean and `sorry`-free. The remaining steps toward `appendSoundnessResidual` are the
run-level seam-merge identity and the probabilistic union bound over the intermediate statement.

/-- **Phase-1 seam restriction of a (malicious) prover** over `pSpec₁ ++ₚ pSpec₂`.
Runs rounds `0 .. m-1` exactly as `P` does, and outputs `P`'s seam state (its `PrvState` at the
last `pSpec₁` round) as the output statement, with trivial output witness. This is the
malicious-prover analogue (left half) absent from the codebase, needed for `appendSoundnessResidual`.

/-- **Phase-1 seam prover recast to an honest `Stmt₂`-output prover.** `Prover.fst P` outputs the seam
*state* (needed by `Prover.snd`), but `V₁.soundness` quantifies over provers whose output statement has
the verifier's output type `Stmt₂`. Since the verifier reads only the *transcript* (never the prover's
output), this recast — identical rounds to `Prover.fst P`, but emitting a fixed dummy claim `c : Stmt₂` —
produces the *same transcript distribution* (`fstCast_runToRound`) yet is a valid `V₁.soundness` prover.
This is the bridge that turns the seam's phase-1 bound (`h₁`) into a direct application of `V₁.soundness`. -/
