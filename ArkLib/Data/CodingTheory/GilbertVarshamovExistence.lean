# The Gilbert–Varshamov existence bound

There exists a code with minimum distance `≥ d` and at least `q^n / V(d−1)` codewords:

  `q^n ≤ |C| · V(d−1)`.

Greedy/maximal-code argument: take a maximum-cardinality code `C` with minimum distance `≥ d`; by
maximality every word is within `d−1` of some codeword (otherwise it could be added), so the
radius-`(d−1)` balls cover the whole space, giving `q^n ≤ |C|·V(d−1)`.  This is the existence
(lower-bound) counterpart to the GV covering bound.  `sorry`/`axiom`-free.
