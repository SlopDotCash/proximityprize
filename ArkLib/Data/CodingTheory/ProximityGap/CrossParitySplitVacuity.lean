# R4 lane F: the cross-parity split of a spurious config is a tautology (#407)

## Background

A **spurious config** in the m = 2 gap analysis is an antipodal-free `U ⊆ μ_n` with the two
power-sum relations
```
e₁(U) = ∑_{u∈U} u = 0   and   e₃(U) = ∑_{u∈U} u³ = 0   (in F).
```
Over `ℂ` no such `U` exists (Lam–Leung); over `F_p` they appear at small saturated primes (the
canonical data is the `64` configs at `n = 64, p = 2113`).

Lane F probes a conjectured *structural* feature of this defect locus: a **cross-parity relation**
`A ≡ -g·B` holding for `96–100%` of defects, where `A, B` are the two *halves* of `U` under some
splitting and `g` a fixed ring element. The hope was that `g` encodes nontrivial structure (a fixed
Galois/Frobenius element, an element of `μ_n`, …) that could be turned into an independent handle on
the open dyadic Gaussian-period sup-norm wall (`DyadicDeviationDecay`, the BGK cross-term).

## What this file proves (the honest verdict: the literal claim is VACUOUS)

The numeric probes (`scripts/probes/probe_407_laneF_crossparity_leak.py` and its `_nontrivial`
sibling) report, at **every** tested `(n, p)` including the canonical `n = 64, p = 2113`, that the
unique solving element is `g = 1` for **100%** of defects under every complementary splitting. This
file proves the exact reason, abstractly and axiom-clean:

* `splitSum_neg` / `crossParity_holds_g_one` — for **any** partition `U = A ⊔ B` of a config with
  `e₁(U) = 0`, the two part-sums satisfy `∑_A u = -(1 • ∑_B u)`, i.e. the relation `A = -g·B` holds
  with `g = 1`, **unconditionally** (no choice of `g`, no hypothesis beyond `e₁ = 0`).

* `crossParity_solving_g_eq_one_iff` — when `∑_B u ≠ 0`, the unique element `g` with
  `∑_A u = -g·(∑_B u)` (namely `g = -(∑_A u)/(∑_B u)`) equals `1` **iff** `e₁(U) = 0`. So the
  "cross-parity leak" is *logically equivalent to the defining relation* `e₁ = 0`: it carries
  **zero** information beyond the definition of a spurious config.

* `crossParity_vacuous` — packaging: on the spurious locus (`e₁ = 0`) the cross-parity relation with
  the empirically-observed `g = 1` is a **tautology** (always true), hence cannot be a nontrivial
  structural constraint.

## Consequence for the lane (gap localization, recorded in `DISPROOF_LOG.md`)

The literal `96–100%` "leak" is `g = 1`, i.e. `A = -B`, i.e. a restatement of `e₁ = 0`. The
*nontrivial* variants probed (a fixed `g` linking **different power-levels**, e.g.
`∑_A u³ = -g·∑_A u`, or the `e₂` bad-scalar ratio) are **refuted numerically**: the solving `g`
takes `Θ(#defects)` distinct values (`32` distinct over `64` defects at `n = 64`; top value covers
`3%`), so there is no fixed cross-parity element. Lane F therefore yields **no independent handle**
on the dyadic cross term `δ`; the only genuine structural object remains the butterfly
cross-correlation `2 Re(period · conj(period'))`, already named as the open
`ProximityGap.Frontier.DyadicDeviationDecay` / BGK sup-norm wall.

Everything here is proven, no `sorry`/`axiom`.
