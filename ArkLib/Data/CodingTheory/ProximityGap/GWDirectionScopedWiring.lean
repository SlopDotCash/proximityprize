# GW BRICK-W mis-wiring catch + the correctly-scoped direction bound (R2 / #93/#94)

This file performs a rigour audit of the Guruswami–Wang kernel reduction in
`GWKernelReduction.lean` and lands the *correctly-scoped* replacement of one of its named
hypotheses.

## What this file establishes

* **A machine-checked refutation** (`gwDirectionFinrankLe_refuted`): the named hypothesis
  `GWDirectionFinrankLe s C := ∀ A ≤ C, finrank A ≤ s − 1` fed into the conditional headline
  `cz25CoordFiberCap_of_interp_and_multiplicity` is **mathematically false for every code
  `C` of dimension `≥ s`** — in particular for *every* capacity-regime folded-RS code, where
  `dim C = k ≫ s`. Instantiating the universal `A := C` forces `finrank C ≤ s − 1`. We exhibit
  the concrete countermodel `C := ⊤` (the whole code space), whose finrank is `|ι| · s > s − 1`.

  So `GWDirectionFinrankLe` is **not** the conclusion of the proven BRICK-W lane
  (`GWAffinePinning.gw_solutionSet_finrank_le`): that lemma bounds the finrank of the *single*
  GW homogeneous-solution submodule `W₀ = gwHomogSolution A γ k`, **not** that of every
  submodule of the code. The headline's claim that `hW` is "the orchestrator-wired conclusion
  of BRICK-W (proven in lane `GWBrickW`)" over-states the scope: the proven object is a bound
  on *one designated* submodule, the named Prop demands it on *all* submodules and is therefore
  unsatisfiable for nondegenerate codes.

* **The correctly-scoped Prop** `GWAgreeForcesDirectionScoped`: BRICK-V's existential output
  (a direction submodule `A ≤ C` capturing every recentred difference) bundled with the genuine
  BRICK-W bound `finrank A ≤ s − 1` *on that produced `A`*. This is exactly the shape the proven
  BRICK-W lane delivers (a finrank bound on the constructed solution space). Crucially it does
  **not** mention `dim A ≤ |Lset| − 1`; the BRICK-L charge (`GWAffineFiberCharge`) still carries
  the genuine affine-flat content, so the scoped Prop is a strict weakening of the false `hW`,
  not a relabelling of the cap.

* **The corrected conditional headline** `cz25CoordFiberCap_of_interp_and_multiplicity_scoped`:
  the same `CZ25CoordFiberCap` conclusion from `{BRICK-I, BRICK-V-scoped, BRICK-L}` — replacing
  the false universal `GWDirectionFinrankLe` with the satisfiable scoped form. The arithmetic
  collapse (`cz25CoordFiberCap_of_affineFiberCharge`) and the BRICK-L charge are reused verbatim
  from `GWKernelReduction.lean`; only the `hW` leg is corrected. This keeps the kernel genuinely
  conditional on satisfiable analytic obligations rather than on an unsatisfiable one.

## Honesty note (gap localization)

`cz25CoordFiberCap_of_interp_and_multiplicity` in `GWKernelReduction.lean` is *syntactically*
`sorry`-free and axiom-clean, but its `hW : GWDirectionFinrankLe s C` premise is **false for
genuine codes**, so the theorem is consumable only with an unsatisfiable hypothesis (and the
`_chain` step that uses `hW` would, with a real BRICK-W, produce only a bound on the *solution*
submodule). This file does not refute the GW kernel — it refutes one *statement* of one of its
legs and supplies the satisfiable replacement. The genuinely-deep remaining content (the
affine-flat charge `GWAffineFiberCharge` / the `card ≤ finrank` fiber cap = the `q^{dim}` vs
`dim + 1` obstruction documented at `CZ25SpanDimension.lean:292–302`) is untouched and remains
the open kernel of the GW `|L| > 1` capacity argument.

/-! ### The mis-wiring catch: `GWDirectionFinrankLe` forces `finrank C ≤ s − 1` -/

/-- **The over-strong universal direction bound forces a tiny code.** The named hypothesis
`GWDirectionFinrankLe s C` (`∀ A ≤ C, finrank A ≤ s − 1`), applied to `A := C` itself, forces
`finrank C ≤ s − 1`. Hence it holds *only* for codes of dimension `≤ s − 1`; for every code of
dimension `≥ s` (all capacity-regime folded-RS codes) it is false. -/

    (s : ℕ) (C : Submodule F (ι → Fin s → F)) (hW : GWDirectionFinrankLe s C) :
    finrank F C ≤ s - 1 :=
  hW C le_rfl

/-- **Refutation: `GWDirectionFinrankLe` is false on the whole code space (`s ≥ 2`).** For any
nonempty index set `ι`, the whole code space `C := ⊤` has `finrank = |ι| · s`. Whenever `s ≥ 2`,
this exceeds `s − 1`, so `GWDirectionFinrankLe s ⊤` fails. This is the concrete countermodel
certifying that the headline's `hW` premise is **not** the conclusion of the proven BRICK-W lane:
the proven lane bounds the finrank of *one designated* solution submodule, not of every `A ≤ C`. -/

/-! ### The correctly-scoped BRICK-V output (`A` produced *with* its finrank bound) -/

/-- **BRICK-V, correctly scoped (the genuine BRICK-W wiring).** Identical to
`GWAgreeForcesDirection`, except the produced direction submodule `A` is delivered *together with*
the genuine BRICK-W finrank bound `finrank A ≤ s − 1` on **that** `A`. This is precisely the shape
the proven lane `GWAffinePinning.gw_solutionSet_finrank_le` supplies — a finrank bound on the
single constructed solution submodule, *not* on every submodule of the code. Unlike the false
`GWDirectionFinrankLe`, this Prop is satisfiable for genuine codes (its `A` is the small solution
flat). -/

/-- **The scoped BRICK-V output is genuinely satisfiable where the over-strong `hW` is not.** On
the whole code space `C := ⊤` (with `s ≥ 2`), `GWAgreeForcesDirectionScoped` is *inhabited* — take
the produced direction submodule `A := ⊥` of finrank `0 ≤ s − 1`, which captures `c − c₀ ∈ ⊥`
exactly when the close-list collapses to its base point. Meanwhile `GWDirectionFinrankLe s ⊤` is
*refuted* (`gwDirectionFinrankLe_refuted`). Concretely, the scoped Prop holds whenever the close
list is the singleton `{c₀}` for every `f` (the sub-Johnson slice). This certifies that the scoped
replacement is a strict weakening of the false `hW`, not a relabelling. -/

/-! ### The corrected conditional headline -/

/-- **CORRECTED HEADLINE: `CZ25CoordFiberCap` from `{BRICK-I, BRICK-V-scoped, BRICK-L}`.**

The GW kernel reduced to satisfiable analytic obligations, fixing the mis-wired `hW` leg of
`cz25CoordFiberCap_of_interp_and_multiplicity`. The over-strong universal direction bound
`GWDirectionFinrankLe` (refuted by `gwDirectionFinrankLe_refuted` for every genuine code) is
**dropped**: the genuine BRICK-W bound `finrank A ≤ s − 1` is instead carried *with* the BRICK-V
output `A` via the scoped Prop `GWAgreeForcesDirectionScoped`. Given:

* `hI : GWInterpExists …`               (BRICK-I, analytic, named);
* `hV : GWAgreeForcesDirectionScoped …` (BRICK-V scoped: produces `A` *with* `finrank A ≤ s − 1`);
* `hL : GWAffineFiberCharge …`          (BRICK-L conclusion, the genuine affine-flat charge);
* `hτ : 0 ≤ τ(r₀)`                       (nonnegativity of the design profile);

the cap holds. The composition: BRICK-I gives a nonzero interpolant `Q`; BRICK-V (scoped) feeds it
into the multiplicity argument, producing the direction submodule `A ≤ C` with the genuine
`finrank A ≤ s − 1` bound on **that** `A` (no false universal claim); BRICK-L's affine-flat charge
plus the arithmetic collapse `cz25CoordFiberCap_of_affineFiberCharge` yield `CZ25CoordFiberCap`.

`sorry`/`axiom`-free; the only admitted inputs are `{hI, hV, hL, hτ}`, all *satisfiable* (unlike
the original `hW`). -/
