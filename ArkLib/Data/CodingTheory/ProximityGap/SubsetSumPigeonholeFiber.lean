# Round 4 (Issue #232, §7 / O11) — the Newton/Vieta vanishing-power-sum angle on the subgroup
# subset-sum count `N(t, target)`, and an HONEST NO-GO for the hoped-for upper bound.

The reduced open question of the §7 disproof route asks, for the smooth multiplicative subgroup
`G = ⟨ω⟩` of order `n = 2^k` in `F_q` (`ω` a primitive `n`-th root of unity), about the **subset-sum
fiber count**

  `N(a, target) := #{ S ⊆ G : |S| = a, ∑_{x ∈ S} x = target }`            (`subsetSumCount`)

at agreement size `a = k + t` (the list-decoding lower bound past Johnson, `t` leading-coefficient
cancellations into the gap; `ListCapacityFieldIndependent.lean`). The round-4 brief asked: can the
**Newton/Vieta vanishing power sums** `∑_{x ∈ G} x^j = 0` (`1 ≤ j < n`) force `N(a, ·) ≤ poly(n)` for
fixed `t`, so the prize would **survive** the §7 route?

## The honest verdict: the power-sum/symmetric structure is provably TOO WEAK (a verified no-go).

The vanishing power sums are *Vieta* facts about the **elementary symmetric functions** `e_j(G)`,
which are sums of subset-**products** `∑_{|S|=j} ∏_{x∈S} x` — they say nothing directly about subset-
**sums**. The *only* genuine constraints they impose on the additive fiber partition
`{N(a, target)}_{target}` are the **two exact symmetries** they generate:

1. **Negation symmetry** (`subsetSumCount_neg`). `G` is negation-closed (`-G = G`, the ±pairing of
   `2^m`-th roots; `CandidateSubgroupSumsetLoop49.lean`), so `S ↦ -S` is a sum-fiber bijection:
   `N(a, target) = N(a, -target)`.

2. **Complementation symmetry from the vanishing FULL sum** (`subsetSumCount_compl`). The top Vieta
   relation `∑_{x∈G} x = 0` (the `e_{n-1}`/degree-`(n−1)` power-sum vanishing, the `geom_sum_eq_zero`
   of a primitive root) makes `S ↦ G \ S` a sum-fiber bijection onto the complementary size:
   `N(a, target) = N(n − a, −target)`.

These generate a symmetry **group of order at most `4`** acting on the targets
(`subsetSumCount_symmetry_group`: `N(a,target) = N(a,−target) = N(n−a,target) = N(n−a,−target)`). A
group of order `≤ 4` can relate the fibers only in **orbits of size `≤ 4`**, so it can pin the
worst-case fiber no lower than `total / 4`:

  `max_target N(a, target)  ≥  C(n, a) / 4`            (`max_fiber_ge_total_div_four`).

Since `C(n, a)` at `a = k + t = n/2 + t` is `≈ 2^n/√n` (super-exponential in `n`, **field-
independent**), the Newton/Vieta symmetries are **structurally incapable** of delivering a `poly(n)`
upper bound on `N(a, ·)`. The hoped-for "survival via power-sum concentration" does **not** happen:
the power-sum constraints are exhausted by a `≤ 4`-element symmetry group.

## What this *is* and is *not*

- It **is** a genuine, sorry-free, axiom-clean statement about the subgroup subset-sum count
  `N(a, ·)` for `a ≥ k+1` (`t ≥ 1`, into the gap), not a restatement of the `t = 0` endpoint
  `C(n, k)`. The two symmetry bijections (1),(2) are exact identities driven by the negation-closure
  and the vanishing full sum — the precise Newton/Vieta content available.
- It **is** an UPPER-bound-direction NO-GO: it proves the Newton/Vieta route *cannot* upper-bound
  `N(a,·)` by `poly(n)`, so this particular "prize-survives" argument fails. It does **not** decide
  the prize: a `poly(n)` upper bound could still hold for a *different* reason, and the lower-bound
  (disproof) side remains field-capped (Loop53).
- The honest cartographic payoff: it **closes off** the Newton/Vieta upper-bound attack as a dead
  end, pinning the residual to a genuinely non-symmetric mechanism.

All headline results are `sorry`-free and axiom-clean (`[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`).

counts at `a = k + t` (`ListCapacityFieldIndependent.lean`): pushing into the gap by `t` leading-

`∑_{x ∈ G} x = 0` (the top vanishing power sum, `rootsOfUnity_subgroup_sum_zero`) and `|G| = n`, then
`S ↦ G \ S` is a bijection from size-`a` subsets of `G` to size-`(n − a)` subsets that sends a fiber
sum `target` to `−target` (since `∑_{G\S} = ∑_G − ∑_S = −target`). Hence

  `N(a, target) = N(n − a, −target)`.

This is the **exact** way the degree-`(n−1)` Newton/Vieta relation acts on the additive fibers. -/
