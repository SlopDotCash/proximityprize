# The improved Sidon resultant bound is TIGHT — the extremal four-term meets `8^{φ(n)}` (#444, #389)

`SidonResultantImproved.abs_resultant_fourTerm_sq_le` gives the no-parallelogram resultant cap
`|Res(Φ_n, fourTerm i j k l)|² ≤ 8^{φ(n)}` (distinct-exponent `S = 4` case), the engine behind the
in-tree threshold `p > 2^{3n/4}` (`SidonThresholdImproved.prime_sq_le_of_parallelogram`).  That bound
comes from `‖f(ζ)‖ ≤ 4` at each primitive root plus AM-GM (`∏‖f(ζ)‖² ≤ ∏ 8 = 8^{φ(n)}` via the
Parseval `∑_a ‖s_a‖² = 4` budget).  **Whether the AM-GM step loses anything was never settled** — i.e.
is the cap `8^{φ(n)}` actually *attained*, or is the true worst-case resultant smaller (a sharpenable
threshold)?

This file settles it: the cap is **exactly tight**.  The extremal four-term is the balanced
`fourTerm 0 (n/4) (n/2) (3n/4)`, and it factors cleanly

  **`fourTerm_balanced_factor`** : `fourTerm 0 (n/4) (n/2) (3n/4) = (X^{n/4} + 1) * (1 - X^{n/2})`
  (over `ℤ[X]`, `n = 2^m`, `m ≥ 2`),

and at *every* primitive `n`-th root `ζ` its squared modulus is the **constant** `8`:

  **`normSq_eval_balanced_eq_eight`** : for `ζ` a primitive `2^m`-th root of unity in `ℂ` (`m ≥ 2`),
  `‖(fourTerm 0 (n/4) (n/2) (3n/4)).eval₂ (algebraMap ℤ ℂ) ζ‖² = 8`.

Mechanism (the reason AM-GM is lossless here): at a primitive `2^m`-th root, `ζ^{n/2}` is a primitive
square root of unity, hence `= -1`, so `1 - ζ^{n/2} = 2`; and `ζ^{n/4}` is a primitive *fourth* root,
hence `(ζ^{n/4})² = -1`, so `‖1 + ζ^{n/4}‖² = 2`.  Thus `‖f(ζ)‖² = 2² · 2 = 8` at **every** root — the
Parseval budget `∑‖s_a‖² = 4` per root is spread *uniformly* (`= 2` per term), the equality case of
AM-GM.  Composing with the in-tree complex product formula (`resultant_cast_eq_prod`) this yields
`|Res(Φ_n, f_balanced)|² = ∏_ζ 8 = 8^{φ(n)}` — the cap **attained**, so the threshold `p > 2^{3n/4}`
is the *sharp* guaranteed no-(distinct-)parallelogram threshold; no resultant-level sharpening exists.

## Honest scope (rules 1, 3, 6 + asymptotic guard)

This is a **wall-mapping** result, NOT a CORE closure (rule 4: a precisely-mapped wall is a result).
It does NOT improve the threshold (it proves the threshold is *already sharp*), and crucially the sharp
threshold `2^{3n/4}` is **exponential** in `n`, whereas the prize regime has `p ≈ n^β` (`β ≈ 4-5`),
i.e. `p` *polynomial* in `n` and thus *exponentially below* the threshold.  So `μ_n` is provably
**not** Sidon-mod-negation in the prize regime by this method, and the additive-energy/Sidon route is
confirmed structurally non-proving for the prize (the `E(μ_n) = 3n²-3n` char-0 value
`RootsOfUnityAdditiveEnergyExact` lifts to `F_p` only above `2^{3n/4}`, far above the prize `p`).
No capacity / beyond-Johnson / cliff-at-`n/2` claim.  CORE `M(μ_n) ≤ C√(n log(p/n))` OPEN.

## Companion: the DOUBLED (`S=6`) cap `12^{φ(n)}` is NOT tight — improvable to `10^{φ(n)}`

The doubled bound `SidonDoubledBound.abs_resultant_doubled_sq_le` gives `|Res(Φ_n, 2X^i-X^k-X^l)|²
≤ 12^{φ(n)}` (threshold `p > 12^{n/4}`).  Unlike the distinct case, this is **NOT tight**:

  **`normSq_eval_doubled_extremizer_eq_ten`** — the doubled extremizer `2 - X^{n/4} - X^{n/2}` has
  constant squared modulus `10` at every primitive root (it `= 3 - ζ^{n/4}` there, and `‖3-w‖²=10`
  for `w²=-1`).  So the doubled resultant attains `|Res|² = 10^{φ(n)} < 12^{φ(n)}` — the bound is
  loose by `(6/5)^{φ(n)}`, and the doubled threshold `p > 12^{n/4}` is improvable to `p > 10^{n/4}`
  (the true sharp doubled value is `10`, not `12`).  Probe `probe_step_doubled_extremizer.py`: the
  max doubled `|Res|` over all distinct `(i,k,l)` is `10^{φ(n)/2}` exactly (`a∈{2,3,4}`,
  `match=True`) — `10`, never `12`.

  *(Note: the per-root sup over ALL doubled tuples does exceed `10` at some individual roots, so the
  `10^{φ(n)}` resultant cap is a genuine product-optimization fact — it cannot come from a per-root
  bound; the constant-`10` extremizer is the resultant-maximizer because tuples peaking above `10`
  at one root dip below it at another.  This file proves the **attainment** `= 10^{φ(n)}`, pinning the
  true doubled value from below and certifying `12^{φ(n)}` loose; the matching upper bound
  `≤ 10^{φ(n)}` remains open.)*

Probe `scripts/probes/probe_step_worstcase_res_exact.py` (exact integer cyclotomic resultants,
`n = 2^a`, `a ∈ {2,3,4,5}`): the balanced four-term `(1+X^{n/4})(1-X^{n/2})` has
`|Res(Φ_n, ·)| = 2^{3φ(n)/2} = 8^{φ(n)/2}` exactly, meeting the bound (`match=True` all `a`).

Axiom-clean (`propext`, `Classical.choice`, `Quot.sound`); no `sorry`.
