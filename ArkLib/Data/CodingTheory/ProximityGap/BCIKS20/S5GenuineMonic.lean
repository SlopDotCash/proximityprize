# BCIKS20 §5.2.6–5.2.7 — Claims 5.8 / 5.8' UNCONDITIONAL for monic `H` (issue #232)

The §5 endpoints in `S5Genuine.lean` (`claim58_genuine`, `claim58prime_genuine`) prove the genuine
BCIKS20 X-degree bound on the Hensel root `γ = gammaGenuine`, but each carries the explicit
combinatorial Appendix-A.4 hypothesis `FaaDiBrunoSuccSumZeroResidual` (equivalently the
  lift-identity
bridge `LiftIdentityAt` / the carved `RestrictedFaaDiBrunoMatch`).

That residual is **PROVEN unconditionally for monic `H`** — `restrictedFaaDiBrunoMatch_of_monic`
(`P2MatchMonic.lean`) discharges the carved Faà-di-Bruno partition match from the genuine algebra
(`taylorCollapse`, `partitionProd_coeff_assembled`, the `W = 1` collapse), using `H.leadingCoeff =
  1`
load-bearingly. This file simply **propagates that discharge up to the §5 Claims 5.8 / 5.8'**, so
  the
X-degree-bound conclusions hold with the residual hypothesis removed.

Why monic is the right (and only correct) form: the residual is **provably false for non-monic `H`**
— `P2OrderZeroRefutationWitness.βHenselAssembled_eq_gammaGenuine_false` exhibits a concrete
`H = 2·Y` over `ℚ` for which the `(A.1)` numerator series is mis-normalized (off by `W^{t+1}`
factors) and is NOT the genuine root. In the BCIKS20 setting `H` is an irreducible factor of the GS
interpolant over `F(Z)`, which is taken monic WLOG, so `H.leadingCoeff = 1` is exactly the genuine
hypothesis; making these claims unconditional under it is the faithful reading.

## What remains open (HONESTY)

This file closes the residual hypothesis at the §5 X-degree endpoints; it does **not** close the
top-level Johnson-regime MCA bound. The entire BCIKS20 Faà-di-Bruno / Hensel development is a
dependency island that the `Hab25*` algebraic-cover bridge does not yet import: the bridge
(`epsMCA_rs_le_johnsonBoundReal_of_algebraic_cover`) consumes a `Hab25JohnsonAlgebraicData` whose
exceptional-scalar cover is never constructed from the Hensel discharge. Wiring those together
(`Hab25JohnsonAlgebraicData.ofMonicHenselFactors`) plus Claim 5.9 (the Z-degree-1 structure) is the
remaining Johnson-regime formalization. None of this is the genuinely-open $1M capacity prize, which
is the field-universal beyond-Johnson core — separate from and beyond this known-math Johnson work.

## Main results (all axiom-clean, all unconditional under `H.leadingCoeff = 1`)

* `claim58_genuine_of_monic` — Claim 5.8: `αGenuine t = 0` from the §5 largeness alone (no
  residual).
* `claim58prime_genuine_tail_of_monic` — the `∀ t ≥ k` tail vanishing (no residual).
* `claim58prime_genuine_of_monic` — Claim 5.8': `γ = ↑(trunc k γ)` (`γ` is a polynomial), no
  residual.
* `gammaGenuine_isPoly_of_monic` — the packaged "`γ ∈ L[X]` of X-degree `< n+1`" existential form.

/-- **Claim 5.8' (genuine, polynomial form), unconditional for monic `H`.**
`γ = γ_k`: the genuine Hensel root `gammaGenuine` equals the coercion of its degree-`< k` truncation
polynomial. The "γ is a polynomial of X-degree `< k`" content with the A.4 residual removed. -/

/-- **BCIKS20 Claim 5.8' packaged (genuine), unconditional for monic `H`.**
The genuine Hensel root `γ = gammaGenuine` IS a polynomial in `(𝕃 H)[X]` of X-degree `< n+1`
(i.e. `≤ n`), given the §5 largeness for every `t ≥ n+1`. Combines the truncation equality
`claim58prime_genuine_of_monic` with the unconditional degree bound
`claim58prime_genuine_natDegree_lt`. This is the faithful machine-checkable form of
`γ = γ_k ∈ L[X]` (fulltext line 1695) with the Appendix-A.4 residual discharged. -/
