# Issue #304 — the remaining debt as ONE named Prop: `BCIKS20RemainingCore`

The [BCIKS20] Theorem 1.5 keystone (`correlatedAgreement_affine_curves`) was reduced to two
open obligations by two independent passes:

* **the large-sector strict-coefficient residual** (`StrictCoeffPolysLargeResidual`,
  `StrictCoeffLargeReduction.lean`): the §5 strict-Johnson extraction restricted to good sets of
  size `> k + 1` — the complementary sector is *free* (pure Lagrange interpolation; the cutoff
  is exact, probed in `scripts/probes/probe_strict_coeff_smallset.py`, 1861/2000 generic
  failures at `card = k + 2` over GF(13));
* **the corrected boundary threshold** (`BoundaryCardStrictInteriorRefutation.lean`,
  `BoundaryThresholdFloorCell.lean`): both nonemptiness leaves of the boundary quantization
  split are *false* (kernel-checked witnesses), and the honest closed-boundary export is the
  §5 statement at a **floor-matched strict** radius `δ'`, transported to the boundary with
  `ε = errorBound δ' > 0` — never the refuted `errorBound (1 − √ρ) = 0`
  (probed in `scripts/probes/probe_boundary_strict_interior.py` and exhaustively at
  `q = 5, n = 4, k = 1` in `scripts/probes/probe_boundary_threshold_floorcell.py`:
  390,625 stacks, threshold fired on 60,625, 0 violations).

This file unifies the two into a single named Prop and a single consuming theorem:

* `BCIKS20RemainingCore k deg domain δ δ'` — the conjunction
  `StrictCoeffPolysLargeResidual δ ∧ StrictCoeffPolysLargeResidual δ'`: the large-sector
  residual at the target radius `δ` (carrying the strict-interior regime) and at the
  floor-matched working radius `δ'` (carrying the corrected boundary route).  The corrected
  boundary threshold *reduces* to the second conjunct: at a strict radius the §6.2 boundary
  residual is vacuous (`¬ δ' < 1 − √ρ` is unreachable), so the O70 front door turns the
  large-sector residual at `δ'` into the full §5 statement at `δ'`, and the O76 floor
  transport carries it to the boundary.
* `correlatedAgreement_of_remainingCore` — **the wiring theorem**: `BCIKS20RemainingCore`
  implies the Theorem 1.5 keystone `δ_ε_correlatedAgreementCurves` at `δ` with
  `ε = max (errorBound δ) (errorBound δ')`.  In the strict interior the max is realized by the
  first conjunct at `ε = errorBound δ` (the literal in-tree Theorem 1.5 shape); at the closed
  boundary `errorBound δ = 0` and the max is the honest O76 export `ε = errorBound δ' > 0`.

Joint satisfiability of the side hypotheses (the conjunction is not demanded in an empty
regime) is probed exactly in `scripts/probes/probe_remaining_core_wiring.py` (exit 0):
8,255 grid points `(n, deg)`, all 8,113 non-lattice boundaries admit the canonical
floor-matched strict `δ' = ⌊δ·n⌋/n` with `errorBound δ' > 0`, lattice boundaries are honestly
excluded (no strict floor-matched radius exists there — that branch stays behind
`BoundaryCardLatticeData`), and the O76 witness reproduces to the digit
(`δ' = 1/4`, `k · errorBound δ' = 4/5`).  Formal satisfiability at the closed boundary is
certified in-tree below (`remainingCore_boundary_witness`), with the honest caveat that at toy
field size both Johnson-branch obligations hold vacuously — the genuine §5 content is a
large-`q` phenomenon.

/-- **The one remaining Prop of issue #304.**  The conjunction of the two reduced open
obligations behind the [BCIKS20] Theorem 1.5 keystone:

1. `StrictCoeffPolysLargeResidual` at the target radius `δ` — the §5 strict-Johnson
   extraction on large good sets (O70: the small sector is free Lagrange interpolation);
2. `StrictCoeffPolysLargeResidual` at the working radius `δ'` — intended floor-matched and
   strictly below the Johnson boundary, where it carries the **corrected boundary threshold**
   (O76/O78): the §6.2 boundary residual is vacuous at strict radii, so this conjunct alone
   produces the full §5 statement at `δ'`, which floor-transports to the closed boundary with
   the honest `ε = errorBound δ' > 0`.

Producers discharge `#304` by proving exactly this Prop; consumers obtain Theorem 1.5 through
`correlatedAgreement_of_remainingCore`.  In the strict interior, instantiate with `δ' = δ`
(the floor match is `rfl`) and the two conjuncts coincide. -/

/-- **The wiring theorem: `BCIKS20RemainingCore` ⟹ Theorem 1.5.**  The one named Prop yields
the [BCIKS20] correlated-agreement keystone at the target radius `δ` with
`ε = max (errorBound δ) (errorBound δ')`:

* in the strict interior `δ < 1 − √ρ` the first conjunct fires through the O70 front door
  (boundary residual vacuous) at `ε = errorBound δ ≤ max …`;
* otherwise (in particular at the closed boundary `δ = 1 − √ρ`, where
  `errorBound δ = 0`) the second conjunct fires at the floor-matched strict radius and
  transports across the cell at `ε = errorBound δ' ≤ max …` — the corrected boundary route.

Side hypotheses are jointly satisfiable at every non-lattice boundary with the canonical
`δ' = ⌊δ·n⌋/n` (probed over 8,255 grid points, 0 violations:
`scripts/probes/probe_remaining_core_wiring.py`); lattice boundaries admit no strict
floor-matched radius and honestly remain behind the `BoundaryCardLatticeData` branch. -/

/-! ## Satisfiability at the closed boundary (the O76 witness instance)

`BCIKS20RemainingCore` is **satisfiable at the closed boundary**: at the O76 witness point
(`ι = Fin 4`, `F = ZMod 5`, `deg = 2`, `k = 1`, `δ = 1 − √(1/2)` non-lattice, canonical
floor-matched `δ' = 1/4`) both conjuncts are theorems.  Honest caveat: both hold *vacuously*
there — at `δ` the strict-Johnson hypothesis `δ < 1 − √ρ` fails, and at `δ' = 1/4` the
Johnson-side hypothesis `(1 − ρ)/2 < δ'` fails (`(1 − 1/2)/2 = 1/4` exactly) — so the toy
instance certifies *consistency* of the conjunction, not its large-`q` content.  The genuine
content of the conclusion at this instance is nonetheless real: the resulting unconditional
export `correlatedAgreementCurves_boundary_witness` asserts the closed-boundary correlated
agreement at threshold `max (0, 4/5) = 4/5`, verified exhaustively over all 390,625 stacks in
`scripts/probes/probe_boundary_threshold_floorcell.py` (threshold fired on 60,625 stacks,
0 violations). -/
