# CS25 #82 — the sharp distance-dependent second moment (toward `ε_ca = 1`)

The covered-fraction half of the CS25 complete-CA breakdown needs a second-moment bound whose
per-pair term *decreases with the codeword weight*.  The loose `ballInterCount ≤ V`
(`sum_closeCount_sq_le`) makes the second moment as large as the first and provably **cannot** reach
the near-capacity covering threshold (the resulting covered-fraction condition
`H_q(δ) − H_2^q(2δ) − 2δ ≥ 0` is negative for large `q`).

This file composes the linear identity `∑_w (closeCount)² = |𝒞|·∑_{v∈𝒞} ballInterCount(r,v)`
(`sum_closeCount_sq_eq_card_mul`) with the shell containment
`ballInterCount(r,v) ≤ #{x : |x| ≤ r ∧ |v| ≤ |x|+r}` (`ballInterCount_le_shell`) into the sharp
second-moment bound whose inner term depends only on `|v|` (a Hamming shell `|v|−r ≤ |x| ≤ r`).
Grouping codewords by weight and feeding the MDS weight-enumerator count `A_w ≤ C(n,w)·q^{w−(n−k)}`
(`rs_near_codeword_count_le`) turns this into the `∑_w A_w · shell(w)` estimate whose leading-order
covered-fraction condition `H_2^q(2δ) − H_2^q(δ) + δ ≤ ρ` **does** hold near capacity — the correct
analytic path for the remaining band (`√`-deviation) arithmetic.

/-- **Sharp distance-dependent second moment.**  `∑_w (closeCount 𝒞 r w)² ≤ |𝒞| · ∑_{v∈𝒞} (shell of
`v`)`, where the shell `#{x : |x| ≤ r ∧ |v| ≤ |x|+r}` depends only on the codeword weight `|v|` and
thins to a sphere as `|v| → 2r`.  Strictly sharper than the loss-of-distance `ballInterCount ≤ V`
bound of `sum_closeCount_sq_le`; this is the foundation of the MDS-weight covered-fraction estimate
for the CS25 `ε_ca = 1` breakdown. -/
