# The agreement set determines the monomial pencil (#407, Action–Orbit machinery)

A brick for the orbit-count route to δ*. The far-line incidence `I(δ)` counts monomial-pencil
parameters `α` for which `x^a + α x^b` is δ-close to `RS[k]`; each such `α` has a maximal
*agreement set* `A = {x ∈ μ_n : x^a + α x^b = g(x)}` for a best degree-`< k` codeword `g`. The
Action–Orbit bad set is `⟨ω^{b−a}⟩`-orbit-closed, and the orbit count `N` is the number of distinct
agreement sets mod rotation.

For that count to be well-defined as a count of *pencils*, a sufficiently large agreement set must
determine `(α, g)` uniquely. This file proves exactly that — **pencil rigidity**:

> if `x^a + α x^b − g` and `x^a + α' x^b − g'` (with `deg g, deg g' < k ≤ b`) both vanish on a set
> `A` with `|A| > b`, then `α = α'` and `g = g'`.

The proof is elementary: the difference `(α − α')·X^b − (g − g')` has degree `≤ b < |A|` yet vanishes
on `|A|` distinct points, hence is the zero polynomial; reading off the `X^b` coefficient gives
`α = α'`, and then `g = g'`. This is the injectivity `agreement set ↦ pencil` underlying the
orbit-count crossing law (`docs/kb/deltastar-orbit-count-reformulation-2026-06-14.md`), validated
numerically (`probe_orbit_count_prize_regime`: n=8 had 40 bad `α` ↔ 40 distinct agreement sets).

/-- **Pencil rigidity.** If two monomial pencils `x^a + α x^b` and `x^a + α' x^b` agree with
degree-`< k` codewords `g`, `g'` on a common set `A` of size `> b` (with `k ≤ b`), then the pencils
coincide: `α = α'` and `g = g'`. Hence a large agreement set determines the pencil parameter. -/
