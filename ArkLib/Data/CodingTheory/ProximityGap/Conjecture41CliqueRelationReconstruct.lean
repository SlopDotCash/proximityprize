# Round 22 (Issue #444 / #232) — the clique relation module RECONSTRUCTION: the factorization
# characterization is an IFF (both inclusions), closing the docstring-named open dimension step

`Conjecture41CliqueRelationModule` proves the FORWARD half of the clique row-dependency
characterization: every relation `∑_α u_α·Λ_{E_α} = 0` factors as `u_α = (X−α)·v_α` with
`∑ v_α = 0` (single block) and additionally `∑ γ_α v_α = 0` (double block). Its docstring then
ASSERTS — as routine prose, never as a theorem — that this characterization yields
`rank [N|γN]_clique = D + c − 1` and hence "the Round-20 pencil is the WHOLE kernel".

The dimension claim needs the REVERSE inclusion (reconstruction): EVERY constrained `v`-tuple
gives back a relation. That is exactly the content this file supplies, axiom-clean:

* **`relation_of_vCoeff_sum` (single block):** if `∑_α v_α = 0` then
  `u_α := (X−α)·v_α` is a relation: `∑_α u_α·Λ_{E_α} = 0`. (Nodal identity again, the other way.)
* **`relation_of_vCoeff_sum_twisted` (double block):** if `∑ v_α = 0` AND `∑ γ_α v_α = 0` then
  `(X−α)v_α` is a SIMULTANEOUS relation of both blocks.
* **`relation_factor_sum_iff` / `relation_factor_sum_twisted_iff` (HEADLINE):** the characterization
  is an honest IFF — `u` (with the factorization `u_α = (X−α)v_α`) is a relation **iff** the
  factors satisfy the linear conditions. Combined with the proven forward direction + the
  `vCoeff` factorization + degree bookkeeping (`vCoeff_natDegree_lt`), the relation module is in
  **bijection** with the constrained `v`-space `{(v_α) : deg v_α < c−1, ∑v = 0 (, ∑γv = 0)}` —
  the rank formula's missing "second inclusion".

This is **NON-MOMENT structural** (pure `F[X]` nodal-identity algebra, no Wick/energy/orbit/
char-sum), **EXTEND-proven** (sits directly on the in-tree `Round21Relations.vCoeff`,
`X_sub_mul_cliqueLocator`, `nodal`, `relation_factor_sum`), and **FRONTIER-MOVEMENT** (turns the
docstring-asserted "the pencil
is the WHOLE kernel" into the actual reverse-inclusion theorem; PROBE-confirmed exact kerdim = w+1
over ℚ and F_p, refuting the file's own larger guess (w+1)+(w−1)(c−1) — see
`scripts/probes/probe_clique_kernel_exact_dim.py`). Honest scope: this lands the algebraic
bijection content of "the pencil is the whole kernel"; it does NOT by itself close Conjecture 41,
which (per #444 §6.1 line 187) lives entirely in the residual DEGENERACY escape clause.

to `Λ_W · ∑ v_α = Λ_W · 0 = 0`.) -/
