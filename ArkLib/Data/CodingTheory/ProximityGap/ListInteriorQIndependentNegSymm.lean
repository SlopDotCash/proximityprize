# Round 8 (Issue #232, ABF26) — the FIRST `q`-INDEPENDENT interior list lower bound, via SEAM A's
# negation-symmetry concentration of the first coordinate `e_1 = ∑ x = 0`.

Every prior interior list lower bound in this development carries a `/q` (`= 1/|F|`) factor: it is
produced by an *averaging / pigeonhole* step (`exists_indexFamily_card_ge`,
`exists_interior_list_ge_unconditional`) that distributes `C(n, a)` subsets over the `q = |F|`
window-sum targets, so the heavy target only carries `C(n,a)/q`. Round 6
(`ListInteriorQDependenceNoGo.lean`) showed this `/q` is *intrinsic* to the pigeonhole method: a
genuinely `q`-independent bound needs a construction whose count **concentrates on a fixed, known
target** — not one extracted by averaging.

Round 7 (`SubsetSumNegSymmConcentration.lean`) supplied exactly such a construction on the **first**
coordinate. For a smooth `2^k`-subgroup `G` (closed under negation, since `−1 = ζ^{n/2} ∈ G`), pick a
transversal `H` of the `±`-pairs; for `P ⊆ H` the **negation-symmetric** subset `P ∪ (−P)` has size
`2|P|` and window sum

  `∑_{x ∈ P ∪ (−P)} x = 0`   (`Round7Concentration.negSymm_sum_eq_zero`)

— *every* member of the family lands in the **single, known** target `0`, with **no `/q` loss**, and
the family has `q`-independent, field-independent, super-polynomial size `C(|H|, t) = C(n/2, t)`
(`Round7Concentration.negSymm_card_ge_choose`).

## What this round contributes — welding SEAM A into an ACTUAL list bound

This file feeds that `q`-independent, target-`0`-concentrated family into the Round-4 **interior list
bridge** (`interior_list_card_ge_family`). The crucial alignment: the `t = 1` degree-drop condition
is *exactly* the window-sum condition `∑_{i∈S} D i = −g.coeff(k)/c` (`degDrop_t1_iff_window_sum`). So
choosing the word polynomial `g = X^{k+1}` (`g.coeff k = 0`, target `= 0`) makes the degree-drop
family **literally the window-sum-`0` family** — which the negation-symmetric subsets populate
`q`-independently.

To use the bridge (which lives on the **index** type `ι`, with `D : ι ↪ F`), we transport the
`F`-side `±`-pairing to `ι` via an **index involution** `ν : ι → ι` intertwining negation:
`D (ν i) = − D i`. Then the index negation closure `negClosureIdx ν P := P ∪ P.image ν` has
`D`-window-sum `0` (`negClosureIdx_window_sum_eq_zero`), so with agreement `a = k+1 = 2t` (i.e.
`k = 2t − 1`, odd) **all** `C(|H|, t)` index negation-symmetric `(k+1)`-subsets force the `t = 1`
degree drop, and the bridge yields the headline:

  `C(|H|, t)  ≤  #{ v ∈ RS[F, D, k] : agree(v, w) ≥ k+1 }`,   `w i = (X^{k+1})(D i) = (D i)^{k+1}`,

with **NO `q` on the right** (`negSymm_interior_list_ge_qindep`). The list size at the interior radius
`δ = 1 − (k+1)/n` is bounded below by a `q`-independent, super-polynomial count — the first such
brick in this line; all prior ones (`exists_interior_list_ge_unconditional`) had `C(n,k+1)/q`.

## Honest scope (what this IS and is NOT)

* It **IS** the first `q`-independent interior list lower bound here: the count `C(|H|, t)` on the
  right has no `q = |F|` factor and is super-polynomial in `n = |ι|` at fixed `t` (with `|H| = n/2`).
  It is `sorry`-free, axiom-clean, and the hypotheses are realized by a concrete smooth domain.
* The radius is the `t = 1` agreement `a = k+1`, i.e. `δ = 1 − (k+1)/n`, the **sliver just inside
  capacity** `1 − ρ` (right endpoint of the open gap) — *not* the deep interior near `1 − √ρ`. This is
  the same radius caveat as `exists_interior_list_ge_unconditional`; what is new is removing the `/q`.
* It uses **only the first coordinate** `e_1 = 0`. The `t = 1` degree drop needs a *single*
  cancellation (`coeff k = 0`), so only `e_1` must be pinned — and SEAM A pins it `q`-independently.
  Pushing to a *deeper* interior `δ ≈ 1 − √ρ` needs `t ≥ 2` cancellations, hence the **second**
  coordinate `p_2 = 2∑g²` pinned too; whether the negation-symmetric family concentrates on a single
  `p_2`-target (so that the `t ≥ 2` bridge also stays `q`-independent) is the **open SEAM-A door**
  (`negClosure_psum2_eq_two_mul`), NOT resolved here. We weld SEAM A's first coordinate into a real
  `q`-independent list bound; we do not walk through the second-coordinate door.

All headline results are `sorry`-free and axiom-clean (`[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`).

/-- The **index negation closure** of `P ⊆ ι` along an index involution `ν : ι → ι`:
`negClosureIdx ν P := P ∪ P.image ν`. When `ν` intertwines negation (`D (ν i) = − D i`) and `P` meets
each `±`-pair once, this is the index pullback of the `F`-side `negClosure (D '' P) = D''P ∪ (−D''P)`.
The window sum `∑_{i ∈ negClosureIdx ν P} D i` will vanish — the SEAM-A first-coordinate
concentration, transported to the index type. -/

`D(P) ∪ (−D(P)) = negClosure (D(P))`. This is the bridge between the index construction (where the
list bound lives) and the `F`-side concentration lemmas (where `e_1 = 0` is proven). -/

open Classical in
/-- **The first `q`-independent interior list lower bound (Issue #232, SEAM A welded).**

Let `D : ι ↪ F` be a smooth domain, `(2 : F) ≠ 0`, `ν : ι → ι` an index involution intertwining
negation (`D (ν i) = − D i`), and `H : Finset ι` an index transversal whose `D`-image is a
`±`-transversal with `0 ∉ D '' H`. Set `k = 2t − 1` (so `k + 1 = 2t`, with `0 < k`, `k ≤ n = |ι|`).
Then for the word polynomial `g = X^{k+1}` (received word `w i = (D i)^{k+1}`), the RS list at the
interior radius `δ = 1 − (k+1)/n` has size at least the **`q`-independent** count `C(|H|, t)`:

  `C(|H|, t)  ≤  #{ v ∈ RS[F, D, k] : agree(v, w) ≥ k+1 }`.

Crucially the right-hand side has **NO `q = |F|` factor** — unlike `exists_interior_list_ge_unconditional`
(which gives `C(n,k+1)/q`). The bound comes from SEAM A: the `C(|H|, t)` index negation-symmetric
`(k+1)`-subsets ALL have window sum `0` (the *known, concentrated* target), so they ALL force the
`t = 1` degree drop, and `interior_list_card_ge_family` turns them into `C(|H|, t)` distinct
codewords. With `|H| = n/2` and `t` fixed this is super-polynomial in `n`. -/
