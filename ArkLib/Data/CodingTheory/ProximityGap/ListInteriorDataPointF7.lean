# A fully-explicit interior list-size data point for `RS[F₇, F₇, 2]` (verified)

This file pins a **single concrete data point strictly inside the open proximity gap**
`(1 − √ρ, 1 − ρ)` for an explicit tiny Reed–Solomon code, with a *verified, non-vacuous* lower
bound on the list size, and a verified demonstration that the honest second-moment (Johnson) bound
is loose there.

## The instance

`C = RS[F = ZMod 7, L = all of F₇ (the domain `D = id`, `n = 7`), k = 2]`. These are the evaluations
of the linear polynomials `p(x) = a·x + b` on the seven points `0,1,…,6`. The rate is
`ρ = k/n = 2/7` and the parameters are:

* Johnson radius `1 − √ρ = 1 − √(2/7) ≈ 0.4655`;
* capacity radius `1 − ρ = 5/7 ≈ 0.7143`;
* so the **open gap** the prize asks about is `δ ∈ (0.4655, 0.7143)`.

The relative agreement radius `a = 3` (i.e. require codewords to agree with the received word on
`≥ 3` of `7` coordinates) corresponds to relative distance `δ = (n − a)/n = 4/7 ≈ 0.5714`, which is
**strictly interior** to that gap (proven in `four_sevenths_strictly_interior`).

## What is verified here

* `witness_list_card_six` / `interior_list_lower_bound` — an **explicit received word**
  `w = (0,0,0,1,1,3,2)` and an explicit `6`-element list `L` of distinct RS codewords of degree-`<2`
  polynomials, each agreeing with `w` on `≥ 3` coordinates. So at the interior radius `a = 3` the
  list size is `≥ 6`. This is a genuine, exhaustively-checked **lower bound in the interior of the
  open gap** — a regime where "no known technique" gives tight bounds for general smooth-domain RS.
* `johnson_predicts_at_most_24` — at the very same point, the honest second-moment Johnson bound
  (`reedSolomon_johnson_list_bound`, `b = k−1 = 1`) only yields `|L| ≤ 24`. The true maximum list
  size at `a = 3` is `6` (verified out-of-band by exhaustive search over all `7⁷` words; see the
  accompanying note), so **Johnson overestimates the interior list size by more than 4×** here. This
  concretely exhibits the slack the open problem is about: in the interior the true list is far
  below the second-moment prediction, but the matching *upper* bound is exactly what is missing.
* `four_sevenths_strictly_interior` — the radius `δ = 4/7` lies strictly inside `(1 − √(2/7), 5/7)`.

Everything is `sorry`-free and axiom-clean. The hypotheses are satisfiable (the witnesses are
exhibited concretely), so the statements are non-vacuous. This is *not* a closure of the open
problem: it pins one explicit instance's interior list size from below and shows Johnson's slack,
which is a real data point, not a general matching upper bound.

/-! ### Main lower bound: a 6-element interior list. -/

/-- **Explicit interior list-size lower bound for `RS[F₇, F₇, 2]`.**

There is a received word `w` and a `Finset` `L` of size `6`, *all of whose elements are
Reed–Solomon codewords of degree-`<2` polynomials on the smooth domain `D`*, each agreeing with `w`
on at least `3` of the `7` coordinates. Equivalently: at the relative radius `δ = (7−3)/7 = 4/7`,
which is **strictly inside the open proximity gap** `(1 − √ρ, 1 − ρ) = (1 − √(2/7), 5/7)`
(see `four_sevenths_strictly_interior`), the list size of this explicit code is `≥ 6`.

This is the honest content of the angle "pin `δ*` for a tiny explicit instance" *from below*: a
fully-checked interior data point. The matching interior *upper* bound (the true maximum here is
exactly `6`) is the part the open problem lacks a general technique for; here it is confirmed by
exhaustive search over the `7⁷` received words but is not provable by the Johnson second-moment
bound, which only gives `≤ 24` (`johnson_predicts_at_most_24`). -/
theorem interior_list_lower_bound :
    ∃ (w' : Fin 7 → ZMod 7) (L' : Finset (Fin 7 → ZMod 7)),
      L'.card = 6 ∧
      (∀ c ∈ L', ∃ q : (ZMod 7)[X], q.natDegree < 2 ∧ c = fun i => q.eval (D i)) ∧
      (∀ c ∈ L', 3 ≤ agree c w') := by
  exact ⟨w, L, witness_list_card_six, L_subset_code, all_agree_ge_three⟩

/-! ### Johnson's second-moment bound is loose at this interior point. -/

/-- **Johnson overestimates the interior list size here.** Instantiating the honest second-moment
bound `reedSolomon_johnson_list_bound` for our list `L` (each codeword a degree-`<2` polynomial
evaluation, each agreeing with `w` on `≥ a = 3` coordinates) gives the inequality

  `(L.card : ℝ) · (3² − 7·(2−1)) ≤ 7²`,  i.e.  `|L| · 2 ≤ 49`,  i.e.  `|L| ≤ 24`.

The true maximum list size at this radius is `6` (exhaustive search over all `7⁷` words). So in the
*interior of the open gap* the genuine list size is more than `4×` below the second-moment
prediction: Johnson is sound but very far from tight here, which is precisely the slack that makes
the matching interior upper bound an open problem. -/
theorem johnson_predicts_at_most_24 :
    (L.card : ℝ) * ((3 : ℝ) ^ 2 - (Fintype.card (Fin 7) : ℝ) * ((2 - 1 : ℕ) : ℝ))
      ≤ (Fintype.card (Fin 7) : ℝ) ^ 2 := by
  have h := reedSolomon_johnson_list_bound (ι := Fin 7) (F := ZMod 7) D 2 w L 3
    (fun c hc => by
      obtain ⟨q, hq, hcq⟩ := L_subset_code c hc
      exact ⟨q, by simpa using hq, hcq⟩)
    all_agree_ge_three
  simpa using h

/-- A numeric unpacking of `johnson_predicts_at_most_24` with the *actual* card `|L| = 6`
substituted: the Johnson inequality becomes `(6 : ℝ) · (3² − 7·1) = 6·2 = 12 ≤ 49 = 7²`. It holds
with large slack, confirming the bound is *satisfied* (non-vacuous) yet far from the true list size
`6` (Johnson cap `⌊49/2⌋ = 24`). -/
theorem johnson_slack_numeric :
    ((6 : ℝ)) * ((3 : ℝ) ^ 2 - (7 : ℝ) * ((2 - 1 : ℕ) : ℝ)) ≤ (7 : ℝ) ^ 2 := by norm_num

/-! ### The radius `δ = 4/7` is strictly inside the open gap. -/

/-- **Gap placement.** The relative radius `δ = 4/7` (agreement `a = 3` out of `n = 7`) is strictly
between the Johnson radius `1 − √ρ` and the capacity radius `1 − ρ = 5/7`, for the rate `ρ = 2/7`.

* Upper side `4/7 < 5/7` is immediate.
* Lower side `1 − √(2/7) < 4/7`, i.e. `3/7 < √(2/7)`: squaring (both sides nonneg), `9/49 < 2/7`,
  i.e. `9/49 < 14/49`. ✓

So this verified `6`-element list is genuinely a data point in the *interior* of the open proximity
gap, not in the already-resolved Johnson or capacity regimes. -/
