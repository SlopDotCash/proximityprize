# No-Excess at the binding radius is a sum-of-roots-of-unity object (#407, C-noexcess lane)

The #407 No-Excess programme isolates all char-`p` bad-count excess into the **Schur factor**
`s_λ(ζ^T)` (the Vandermonde/interpolation factor never degenerates — `VandermondeInterpolationSafe`).
The lane's hope was a **large-index flatness** of that Schur factor: `s_λ(ζ^T)` small/non-amplifying
at index `(q−1)/n ≈ 2^128`.

This file records the structural fact that **kills that hope at the binding radius** (the
lowest far exponent, `b = k+1`, i.e. degree pattern `d = b − k = 1`).  By the Schur/Lagrange
bridge (`dividedDifferencePow_card_eq_sum`, already in the tree), the divided difference of
`x^{#s}` over a node set `s` is exactly the **point sum** `Σ_{i ∈ s} v i` — i.e. the first Schur
value `h_1 = e_1`.  Specialising the nodes to powers of a primitive `n`-th root `v i = ζ^{a i}`
(the smooth domain `μ_n`), the binding Schur factor becomes

  `[ζ^T] x^{#T}  =  Σ_{i} ζ^{a i}`,

a **sum of distinct `n`-th roots of unity** (distinct by separability, `pow_comp_injective`).
So the No-Excess obstruction at the binding radius is literally the cyclotomic-integer
`Σ_i ζ^{a i}`, whose prime-divisibility (a deployment prime `q` makes it vanish mod `q`) is the
**vanishing-sums-of-roots-of-unity / additive-coincidence** object — *the same wall* as the
character-sum (BGK) face, not an independent count-side escape.

**Numerical corroboration** (`/tmp/probe_schur_exact_norm.py`, this session): the worst prime
factor of `N(Σ_i ζ^{a i})` over 3-element `T ⊆ {0,…,n−1}` is `17, 449, 204353` for
`n = 16, 32, 64` (`log_n = 1.02, 1.76, 2.94`, **accelerating** → `n^{Θ(log n)}`), reached at the
maximally-clustered `T = (0,1,3)`.  This **exactly matches** the `d = 1` Schur-factor norm growth,
confirming the binding No-Excess factor does *not* enjoy large-index flatness — its bad primes
grow quasi-polynomially, reaching prize scale, identically to the additive-energy wall.

Honest scope: this is the **reduction** (binding Schur factor `=` 3-term root sum), proven
axiom-clean below; the *quantitative* growth is the numeric probe, not a Lean theorem.  It does
not close the prize — it **localises** the No-Excess count lane onto the *known* sum-of-roots wall.

All results are `sorry`-free; the axiom audit must show only `propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound`.

/-- **The binding Schur factor is the point sum.**  For an injective node map `v` on a finite
nonempty `s`, the divided difference of `x^{#s}` (the first nontrivial Schur value `h_1 = e_1`,
attained at the binding radius `b = #s`) is exactly `Σ_{i ∈ s} v i`.  This is the in-tree
`dividedDifferencePow_card_eq_sum`, repackaged as the No-Excess binding identity. -/

Specialise the nodes to powers of a primitive `n`-th root, `v i = ζ ^ a i`, with the exponents
`a : ι → ℕ` injective and `< n` (so the powers are distinct — separability).  Then the binding
Schur factor `[ζ^T] x^{#s}` equals `Σ_{i ∈ s} ζ ^ (a i)`, a sum of distinct roots of unity. -/

/-- **The No-Excess binding obstruction is sum-of-roots-of-unity vanishing.**  A deployment field
`F` (containing a primitive `n`-th root `ζ`) makes the binding Schur factor *vanish* — i.e. picks
up the No-Excess bad direction at the binding radius — **iff** the sum of the distinct `n`-th roots
`Σ_{i ∈ s} ζ ^ (a i)` is zero in `F`.  Over `ℂ` this is a (generic) nonzero cyclotomic integer; the
question of which deployment primes `q` make it vanish mod `q` is exactly the
vanishing-sums-of-roots-of-unity / additive-coincidence problem — the same wall as the
character-sum face.  (No independent count-side escape at the binding radius.) -/
