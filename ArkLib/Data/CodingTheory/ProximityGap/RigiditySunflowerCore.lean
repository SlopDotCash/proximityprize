# Round 27 (Issue #232) — THE SUNFLOWER-CORE REDUCTION: shared vertices divide out, window intact

The non-disjoint half of Step 2's assembly (O50 item (ii)), reducing arbitrary equal-window
families to the DISJOINT case handled by Rounds 25–26. The key is the **degree-of-difference
formulation** of window agreement — `(P₁ − P₂).degree < d` ⟺ the top coefficients agree down
to degree `d` — under which the reduction is three lines:

* **`cofactor_window` (the engine):** in a domain, if `Q ≠ 0` and the products `Q·R₁, Q·R₂` agree
  in their top window (`(Q·R₁ − Q·R₂).degree < d`), then the cofactors agree in the
  correspondingly shifted window: `(R₁ − R₂).degree < d − deg Q`. Proof: `Q·R₁ − Q·R₂ = Q·(R₁−R₂)`
  and `degree_mul` — the common factor's degree subtracts off exactly.

* **`nodal_core_split`:** `Λ_A = Λ_{A∩B} · Λ_{A∖B}` (the shared core factors out of the nodal
  polynomial), and `A∖B`, `B∖A` are disjoint.

* **`sunflower_core_reduction` (the assembled theorem):** if `Λ_A` and `Λ_B` agree in their top
  window, then the residual nodals `Λ_{A∖B}` and `Λ_{B∖A}` — of DISJOINT sets — agree in the
  same-width window (shifted by the common core's degree). The residual sets then feed the
  verified disjoint machinery: R25 (`t=1` ⟹ antipodally closed) + R26 (window halving) ⟹ the
  `2^k`-lift structure on the residuals — the SUNFLOWER form: common core + lift-structured
  petals, generalizing R24's `w=3` classification to all sizes and all windows.

With this, Step 2's reduction chain is complete over verified components: arbitrary equal-window
pair → core division (this file) → disjoint residuals → antipodal closure (R25) → window halving
(R26, iterated) → `2^k`-lift petals (R22 floor = ceiling). Remaining assembly: the level-iteration
statement and the final Conjecture-41/δ* composition.

/-- **THE SUNFLOWER-CORE REDUCTION.** If the nodal polynomials of `A` and `B` agree in their top
window (`(Λ_A − Λ_B).degree < d`), then the residual nodals of the DISJOINT sets `A∖B` and `B∖A`
agree in the core-shifted window:

  `degree Λ_{A∩B} + (Λ_{A∖B} − Λ_{B∖A}).degree < d`.

The residual (disjoint) pair then feeds the verified disjoint-case machinery (R25 antipodal
closure + R26 window halving), forcing the sunflower form: common core `A∩B` plus `2^k`-lift
petals. Note `B ∩ A = A ∩ B` (`inter_comm`) aligns the two core factors. -/
