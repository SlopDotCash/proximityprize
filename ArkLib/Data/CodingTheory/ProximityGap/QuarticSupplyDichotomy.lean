# The deep-band quartic-supply dichotomy: `2 ∣ n` ⟹ nonzero (#389)

`CubicSupplyDichotomy.lean` lands the `k = 2` (cubic, word `x³`) deep-band dichotomy via the
`3 ∣ n` condition (cube-root triples).  This file lands the **next rate** — `k = 3`, the
quartic word `x⁴` — using the freshly-landed `general_orchard_card` (the RS-code orchard
identity at every rate), reducing the deepest-band supply of `x⁴` to the **zero-sum-4-subset
count** of the domain.

The arithmetic of that count is a clean **parity** dichotomy (Mann / Conway–Jones for `k+1 = 4`
terms: four distinct `n`-th roots of unity sum to zero **iff** they split into two antipodal
pairs `{a, −a, c, −c}`, which requires `−1 ∈ μ_n`, i.e. `2 ∣ n`):

> **`quarticSupply_mu5_F11_eq_zero`** — `x⁴` on `μ_5 = ⟨3⟩ ⊂ F₁₁` (odd `n = 5`, so `2 ∤ n`,
> no antipodal pairs) has **0** explainable `4`-cores.  (Each `4`-subset of `μ_5` is the
> complement of a singleton, summing to `−x ≠ 0`.)
>
> **`quarticSupply_mu6_F7_eq_three`** — `x⁴` on `μ_6 = F₇^× ⊂ F₇` (even `n = 6`, so `2 ∣ n`)
> has exactly **3** explainable `4`-cores: the three antipodal-pair-complements
> `{1,2,5,6}, {1,3,4,6}, {2,3,4,5}` (complements of `{3,4}, {2,5}, {1,6}`, each a zero-sum
> antipodal pair).

Together this is the exact `k = 3` deep-band dichotomy, mirroring the cubic case one rate up:

  `2 ∤ n  ⟹  quartic supply 0` (no antipodal pairs, e.g. `μ_5`);
  `2 ∣ n  ⟹  quartic supply ≥ 1` (antipodal-pair complements, e.g. `μ_6`).

A third witness fixes the **growth rate** on the prize-relevant 2-power domain:

> **`quarticSupply_mu8_F17_eq_six`** — `x⁴` on `μ_8 = ⟨2⟩ ⊂ F₁₇` (the FRI-shaped 2-power
> domain, `n = 8`) has exactly `6 = C(n/2, 2)` explainable `4`-cores: every pair of the four
> antipodal pairs `{1,16}, {2,15}, {4,13}, {8,9}` is a zero-sum quadruple.  So the deepest-band
> quartic supply is `Θ(n²)` — polynomial (consistent with `δ* = capacity − Θ(1/log n)`) but
> strictly larger than the cubic word's supply.

So the deepest pre-capacity (sub-Johnson) supply of the tower-shaped word `x⁴` is governed by
the parity of `n` — the `k = 3` instance of the general orchard identity, exhibited at three
concrete fields.  Issue #389.
