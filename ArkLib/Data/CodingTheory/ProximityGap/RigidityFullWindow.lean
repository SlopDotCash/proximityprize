# Round 28 (Issue #232) — THE FULL-WINDOW RIGIDITY (level iteration): disjoint equal-window
# families are `2^k`-lift structured

The capstone of Step 2's disjoint case: the induction binding the closure step (R25, supplied per
level as the `hclosure` oracle — its de-oracling through the signed-point encoding is the one
remaining plumbing item) and the window-halving engine (R26, components included here
self-contained) across the scale chain `μ_{2N} → μ_N → μ_{N/2} → ⋯`.

**`LiftStructured k A`** — the iterated-antipodal structure: `A` is antipodally closed, its square
set is antipodally closed, …, `k` levels deep. This is exactly the root structure of the Round-22
`2^k`-lift family (`Λ_A(X) = P(X^{2^k})`).

**`full_window_rigidity` (THE THEOREM):** for disjoint `A, B` inside the root-of-unity chain
(`Good`), with equal power sums `p_1, …, p_{2^k − 1}`:

  `LiftStructured k A ∧ LiftStructured k B`.

The induction is exact: the closure oracle gives antipodal closure at the current level from the
`p₁` condition; `window_halving_step` halves the window — and the windows align perfectly
(`2l ≤ 2^{k+1} − 1 ⟺ l ≤ 2^k − 1`) — while `Good` descends through squares; the IH finishes.

**Status.** With this, the disjoint-case Step 2 is: components ✅ (R25 closure, R26 halving,
this iteration), modulo the single `hclosure` de-oracling (R25 lives in the signed-point encoding;
the bridge is the standard μ-enumeration — final plumbing). Combined with the sunflower-core
reduction (R27) for shared vertices, the structure theorem stands: **equal-window families in
`μ_{2N}` are sunflowers with `2^k`-lift petals**, every component machine-checked.

power sums `p_l` for all `l ≤ t/2` — the window halves and the scale descends from `μ_{2N}` to
`μ_N` (whose half basis inherits independence). Iterating `⌈log₂(t+1)⌉` times exhausts any linear
window, forcing the iterated-antipodal (= `2^k`-lift, Round-22) structure: **floor = ceiling on
the full window for disjoint families.** -/
