# The first deep band is sub-Johnson at almost every rate (#389)

`DeepBandProductionSubJohnson.lean` proved the first deep band (`m = 0`) strictly
sub-Johnson at rate `≤ 1/2` (`2k ≤ n`).  That hypothesis is far too conservative:
the sharp threshold is essentially rate `1`.

This file pins the **sharp rate threshold** for the first band.  For `5 ≤ k`,
`(k+1)² ≤ n·(k−1)` holds as soon as `n ≥ k + 4` — i.e. at *every* rate
`ρ = k/n ≤ k/(k+4)`, which tends to `1`.  Hence the in-tree above-Johnson
discharge `subJohnsonListBound_aboveJohnson` is provably inapplicable across the
entire production rate range bar a vanishing top sliver, not merely the
low-rate half.

The threshold is tight at the boundary of its hypothesis: at `k = 5`, `n = k+4 = 9`
gives `(k+1)² = 36 = n·(k−1)` exactly, so `k + 4` cannot be lowered to `k + 3`
without failing at large `k` (`(k+1)² > (k+3)(k−1)` for all `k`).

This continues the boundary-pinning of #389: it does **not** close the open
sub-Johnson list bound — it shows the above-Johnson route cannot reach the deployed
regime at essentially any rate, so that single obligation is genuinely unavoidable.

Axiom-clean (`propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound`); no `sorry`.
