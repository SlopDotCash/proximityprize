# Coset rigidity of the power map (Route B: pure fiber counting)

This file formalizes the "Coset Rigidity" lemmas underlying the multiplicative-blowup
argument of the Proximity Gap line of work
(`research/proximity-prize/multiplicative-blowup`, §A).

The core observation is purely group-theoretic: in a finite *cyclic* group `G` of order
`n`, the power map `x ↦ x ^ d` is a group homomorphism (`powMonoidHom d`) whose fibers are
the cosets of its kernel.  Hence every nonempty fiber `{x | x ^ d = c}` has cardinality
equal to that of the kernel, and the kernel — being `{x | x ^ d = 1}` — has cardinality
exactly `Nat.gcd d n`.  Therefore the monomial-agreement set is either empty or has
cardinality exactly `Nat.gcd d n`.

## Route B (fiber counting, no generator)

* `powMonoidHom d : G →* G` is `x ↦ x ^ d` on a commutative group.
* All nonempty fibers of a `MonoidHom` between finite groups are equinumerous
  (`MonoidHom.card_fiber_eq_of_mem_range`).
* The fiber over `1` is the kernel, whose cardinality for a finite cyclic group is
  `Nat.gcd (Nat.card G) d` (`IsCyclic.card_powMonoidHom_ker`).

The only cyclic-specific input is the kernel-cardinality fact; everything else is generic
finite-group fiber counting.

## Main results

* `pow_eq_card_eq_zero_or_gcd` : Lemma 1, the monomial-agreement dichotomy.
* `binomial_agreement_card` : the consumable corollary for `c₁ * x ^ a = c₂ * x ^ b`.
* `binomial_agreement_card_le` : the `≤ a - b` leg of the corollary.
* `binomial_separation` : the rigidity statement in the form the dossier consumes
  (agreement strictly below `k`).

The `d = 0` case is handled honestly: there the agreement set is `univ` (if `c = 1`) or
`∅`, and `Nat.gcd 0 n = n = Fintype.card G`, so the dichotomy statement remains true.

We phrase the corollary over an arbitrary finite cyclic commutative group `G`; the `n`-th
roots of unity `μ_n ⊆ Fˣ` of a field form exactly such a group (a finite subgroup of `Fˣ`
is cyclic), so this is the abstract content of the field-theoretic statement.

/-- **Lemma 1 (monomial agreement / coset rigidity).**

In a finite cyclic commutative group `G` of order `n = Fintype.card G`, for any exponent
`d : ℕ` and target `c : G`, the solution set `{x | x ^ d = c}` is either empty or has
cardinality *exactly* `Nat.gcd d n`.

Proof (Route B): the set is a fiber of `powMonoidHom d`.  Either `c` is not in the range
(empty fiber, card `0`) or it is, in which case the fiber is equinumerous with the fiber
over `1`, i.e. with the kernel `{x | x ^ d = 1}`, whose cardinality is `Nat.gcd d n`. -/

/-- **Corollary (binomial monomial-agreement bound).**

For a finite cyclic commutative group `G` of order `n`, constants `c₁ c₂ : G` and exponents
`a b : ℕ` with `b < a`, the agreement set `{x | c₁ * x ^ a = c₂ * x ^ b}` is either empty or
has cardinality exactly `Nat.gcd (a - b) n`.

Derived from `pow_eq_card_eq_zero_or_gcd` by dividing by `x ^ b` (`x` is a group element,
hence invertible): the equation is equivalent to `x ^ (a - b) = c₂ * c₁⁻¹`. -/

/-- The `≤ a - b` leg of the binomial corollary: the agreement count is at most `a - b`.

whenever `a - b ≠ 0`, which holds because `b < a`. -/

/-- **Binomial separation.**

If `0 < b < a ≤ k`, then two distinct monomials `c₁ * X ^ a` and `c₂ * X ^ b` agree on
*strictly fewer* than `k` points of a finite cyclic group `G`.

This is the rigidity statement in the form the multiplicative-blowup dossier consumes: the
agreement count is bounded by `a - b`, and `a - b < k` is pure arithmetic from
`0 < b`, `b < a`, `a ≤ k`.  (The hypothesis `0 < b` is necessary for the *strict* bound:
when `b = 0` one only gets `a - b = a ≤ k`.) -/
