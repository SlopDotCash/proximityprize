# The genuine-quadruple obstruction IS Sidon-modulo-negation (#444 k=2 / `ν` face)

`E2CharFreeLowerBound` proved the char-free LOWER bound `E2(μ_n) ≥ 2n²−n` and named the exact
obstruction to the matching UPPER bound `E2(μ_n) ≤ 3n²−3n` as the Prop
`E2CharFree.GenuineQuadruple` (a normalized extra additive relation `1 + B = C + D` with
`{1,B} ≠ {C,D}`).  Its docstring asserts in prose that the upper bound "is equivalent to the
NON-existence of a genuine quadruple", but that connection was left as a HOOK, never a theorem.
Separately, `SidonEnergyIff` / `AdditiveEnergyCharacterization` closed
`E2(G) = 3n²−3n ↔ SidonModNeg G`.  The missing brick is the bridge between the two obstruction
objects: the char-free `GenuineQuadruple` Prop and the structural `SidonModNeg` hypothesis that
all the energy-exact theorems consume.

This file supplies that bridge.  The subtlety the prose glossed (and the probe makes precise):
`SidonModNeg` permits the ZERO-SUM coincidence branch, so `GenuineQuadruple` as stated is NOT the
exact complement, the genuine quadruples with `1 + B = 0` (i.e. `B = -1`) are present on every
negation-closed `μ_n` regardless of Sidon-ness.  The exact complement is the genuine quadruple
with **nonzero sum**:

> `GenuineQuadrupleNZ G : ∃ B C D ∈ G, 1 + B = C + D ∧ 1 + B ≠ 0 ∧ {1,B} ≠ {C,D}`

and the headline (the universal, `1`-normalized direction + its contrapositive) is

> **`not_genuineQuadrupleNZ_of_sidonModNeg`**, for `1 ∈ G` over a field:
> `SidonModNeg G → ¬ GenuineQuadrupleNZ G`.
> **`not_sidonModNeg_of_genuineQuadrupleNZ`**, the contrapositive:
> a nonzero-sum genuine quadruple breaks `SidonModNeg`.

HONEST SCOPE OF THE CONVERSE (the full `iff`).  The reverse implication
`¬ GenuineQuadrupleNZ G → SidonModNeg G` is NOT free for a GENERAL finite set: `SidonModNeg` is a
`∀`-statement over EVERY distinguished left element `a ∈ G`, whereas `GenuineQuadrupleNZ`
normalizes only to the single element `1`.  For a MULTIPLICATIVELY-closed `μ_n` the two coincide
(any coincidence `a + b = c + d` divides through by `a ∈ μ_n` to the `1`-normalized form, since
`a⁻¹ ∈ μ_n` and `μ_n` is closed under multiplication), and the probe confirms the resulting `iff`
holds 0/12 fails on PROPER thin `μ_n`.  We do NOT formalize that multiplicative normalization here
(it would require the subgroup-closure hypotheses); the universal content is the two complete
theorems above, and the `μ_n`-specialized `iff` is recorded as probe-validated, not asserted as a
general-set theorem.  Composing the forward direction with
`additiveEnergy_eq_iff_sidonModNeg` already gives the half that `E2CharFreeLowerBound` needs:
`E(G) = 3|G|²−3|G| → ¬ GenuineQuadrupleNZ G`.

## Probe

`scripts/probes/probe_genuinequad_sidonmodneg.py` (PROPER thin `μ_n`, `n = 2^a`, prize-regime
`p ≫ n³`, `p ≡ 1 mod n`, 3 primes per `n`, NEVER `n = q−1`): across `n = 4..32` the bridge holds
0/12 fails, `SidonModNeg G` exactly when the count of nonzero-sum genuine quadruples is `0`
(witness: `n = 32, p = 32993` is NOT SidonModNeg and has `24` nonzero-sum genuine quadruples),
while the zero-sum genuine quadruples (`B = -1`) number `2n−2` regardless, confirming the
nonzero-sum restriction is essential and not cosmetic.

## Scope (rule 3 / rule 6, honesty contract)

NOT a CORE closure, NOT thinness-essential: pure char-free / field-universal additive combinatorics
(it relates two Props about a finite set; thickness never enters).  It does NOT supply whether
`μ_n` actually IS Sidon-mod-negation at the prize prime; that (the `energyExcess = 0` question,
equivalently the non-existence of a nonzero-sum genuine quadruple at `p ~ n⁴`) is the open
field-arithmetic / sum-product input that `SidonEnergyIff` already names, the `k = 2` shadow of
the BGK wall.  CORE (`M(μ_n) ≤ C√(n log(p/n))`) stays OPEN.  This brick only WIRES the char-free
obstruction Prop into the full `SidonModNeg ↔ E2-exact ↔ repCount≤2` characterization, completing
the hook `E2CharFreeLowerBound` left open.

Axiom-clean (`propext`, `Classical.choice`, `Quot.sound`); no `sorry`.
