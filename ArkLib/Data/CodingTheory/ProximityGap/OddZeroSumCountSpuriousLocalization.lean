# The odd-order zeroSumCount is supported ENTIRELY on the char-`p` spurious set (#444, #407)

`OddZeroSumCountVanishCharZero.zeroSumCount_odd_dyadicRoots_eq_zero` proves the located
thinness-essential prize object vanishes at every ODD order over `ℂ`:

>   for every ODD `r`,   `zeroSumCount (μ_{2^k} : Finset ℂ) r = 0`.

That brick's docstring asserts (in prose) the consequence:

>   "the nontrivial signed cancellation that is the open BGK wall appears ONLY ... over the
>    finite field `F_q`, where the `F_q`-reduction creates the zero-sum coincidences char 0
>    forbids.  This LOCATES the entire odd-order prize content squarely in the finite-field
>    reduction."

This file makes that prose a **theorem**: over an arbitrary commutative ring `R` carrying a
"reference" comparison map `φ : R → ℂ` (the char-0 lift of the roots of unity), the odd-order
`zeroSumCount` of a set `G ⊆ R` whose image under `φ` has *no* odd zero-sums equals the count of
its **spurious** tuples — the `R`-zero-sum tuples whose `φ`-image does **not** vanish:

  **`zeroSumCount_eq_spuriousCount_of_image_odd_free`** :
    if `zeroSumCount (G.image φ) r = 0` (no odd-order `φ`-image zero-sum), then
    `zeroSumCount G r = spuriousZeroSumCount G φ r`.

The mechanism is a clean partition: an `R`-zero-sum `r`-tuple `c` either has `∑ φ(c i) = 0`
(a *genuine* / char-0-explained zero-sum) or it does not (a *spurious* / char-`p`-only collision).
When the `φ`-image has no odd zero-sums, the genuine part is forced empty (every genuine tuple
would be a `φ`-image zero-sum tuple), so the whole count is spurious.

Specialized to the prize subgroup, with `φ` the canonical `ℂ`-embedding and the char-0 vanishing
brick supplying the hypothesis automatically, this gives an **unconditional identity** for the
prize regime: the entire odd-order `zeroSumCount` of `μ_n` over any field that maps to `ℂ`-roots is
the count of its char-`p` spurious tuples.

## Probe (rule 2)

`probe_odd_zerosum_charp_spurious.py`: over `F_p` (PROPER thin `μ_n`, `n = 2^a`, multiple primes
incl `p ≫ n³` and Fermat `257, 65537`, NEVER `n = q−1`), for odd `r ∈ {3,5}`, the F_p zero-sum
count splits into genuine (`ℂ`-lift `= 0`) and spurious (`ℂ`-lift `≠ 0`).  Result over 36 cases:
**genuine `= 0` in EVERY case** (the entire odd-order F_p zero-sum count is spurious), and for the
deep `p ≫ n³` primes the spurious count is itself `0` (no odd zero-sums survive below the girth).
This is exactly the identity proven here, with the char-0 odd-vanishing supplying `genuine = 0`.

## Scope (rule 3 / rule 6, honesty contract)

NOT a CORE closure, NOT a refutation.  This is a structural **localization identity**: it does NOT
bound the spurious count (that count — `q·W_r − n^r` for the signed period-power, growing at the
deep `F_q` orders — IS the open BGK wall).  It says only WHERE the odd-order signal lives: entirely
in the spurious set, never in a char-0-explained zero-sum.  NON-MOMENT (an exact additive-tuple
count, no `|·|`); EXTEND-proven (consumes the char-0 odd-vanishing brick verbatim as the
genuine-empty hypothesis).  Field-universal in `R`; the thinness enters only through the char-0
vanishing it specializes against.  No capacity / beyond-Johnson / cliff-at-n/2 / `δ*→0` claim.
`CORE M(μ_n) ≤ C·√(n·log(q/n))` stays OPEN.
