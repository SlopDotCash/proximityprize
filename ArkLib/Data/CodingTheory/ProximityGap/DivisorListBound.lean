# The divisor-counting list bound (#389, the char-0-cyclotomic route)

For a word `w` (as a polynomial) on the smooth domain `μ_n = {x : xⁿ = 1}`, the agreement
of a degree-`<k` codeword `c` with `w` is `deg gcd(w − c, Xⁿ − 1)` (the number of common
roots).  This file lands the **structural heart** of the divisor route to the past-Johnson
list:

> **`gcd_injOn_aux`** — on the list `{c : deg c < k, deg gcd(w−c, Z) ≥ a}` with `a ≥ k`,
> the map `c ↦ gcd(w−c, Z)` is **injective**: two such codewords share a gcd `D` of degree
> `≥ a > deg(c−c')`, and `D ∣ (c−c')` forces `c = c'`.

> **`list_card_le_gcdImage`** — consequently the list injects into the divisors of `Z` it
> produces: `|list| = |image of c ↦ gcd(w−c, Z)|`, and every image element divides `Z`
> with degree `≥ a`.  Hence

>   `|list| ≤ #{monic divisors D of Z : deg D ≥ a}`.

**Why this is the right route, and why it is hard.** Over `ℚ`, `Z = Xⁿ − 1 = ∏_{d∣n} Φ_d`
has only `O(log n)` cyclotomic factors, so `O(n)` divisors total — a *polynomial* list,
the whole conjecture, for free.  Over the deployed split field `F_q` (`n ∣ q−1`), `Z`
splits into `n` linear factors, giving `2ⁿ` divisors — the bound goes vacuous.  The
past-Johnson wall is *exactly* this gap: the divisor count is poly in characteristic zero
and exponential over the split field, and bridging them requires controlling which
divisors actually carry a low-degree residue of `w` — the open `CensusDomination` content.
This file proves the route's injective backbone unconditionally; the divisor *count* over
`F_q` is the open core.  Issue #389.

/-- **The list-decoding gcd is injective on low-degree codewords.**  Two degree-`<k`
codewords whose shifted gcds with `Z` agree, when that gcd reaches degree `≥ a ≥ k`, are
equal: `D := gcd(w−c, Z) = gcd(w−c', Z)` divides `c'−c`, whose degree is `< k ≤ a ≤ deg D`,
forcing `c' − c = 0`. -/
