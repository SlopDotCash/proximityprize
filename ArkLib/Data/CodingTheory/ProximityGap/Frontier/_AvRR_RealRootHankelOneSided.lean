# Real-rootedness / Hankel-PSD constrains the top power sum only from BELOW (#444)

**Task (saddle `E_r ≤ Wick` via the conjugate SIGN structure).**  The period polynomial of
`μ_n = {2^μ-th roots}` is real-rooted (`F1`): its `f` Galois conjugates `η_c` are real, with
fixed low moments `p_1 = -1`, `p_2 = p - n`.  The energy ladder is the even power sum
`E_r = p_{2r} = Σ_c η_c^{2r}`, and the prize-relevant saddle is the UPPER bound
`E_r ≤ Wick_r = f·(2r-1)‼·n^r` at depth `r ≈ log p`.

The DEEP question of this lane: does real-rootedness *itself* (i.e. the constraint that the
`η_c` are the real roots of a real polynomial — equivalently the Hamburger moment condition
that every Hankel matrix `H_k = [p_{i+j}]_{0≤i,j≤k}` is PSD) bound `p_{2r}` from ABOVE by `Wick`?

**Verdict (this file): NO — it is a one-sided constraint that caps the top power sum only from
below.**  This is a clean structural no-go, distinct from the symmetric-functional no-go (those
read the geomean) and the variational no-go (one-sided lower): the *entire* real-measure /
moment-problem machinery is, on the top moment, a LOWER bound, hence vacuous for the prize
upper bound.

## The mechanism (the load-bearing identity)

By Laplace cofactor expansion along the bottom row, the order-`r` Hankel determinant is
**affine in the top moment** `t = p_{2r}` (the bottom-right entry):

  `det H_r(t) = (det H_{r-1}) · t + C`,

where `C` is independent of `t` and the slope is the leading principal minor `det H_{r-1}`.
For a genuine `f`-point real measure with `f > r`, `det H_{r-1} > 0` (a strictly positive
Hankel minor).  Hence `det H_r` is a strictly INCREASING affine function of `t`, so the PSD
constraint `det H_r ≥ 0` is equivalent to `t ≥ threshold` — a **lower** bound on `p_{2r}`,
never an upper bound.

This file proves, axiom-clean:

* `hankel3_det_affine_in_top`: the order-2 (3×3) Hankel determinant is exactly
  `(p0·p2 - p1²)·t + C` in the top moment `t = p_4` — the affine law with slope = the
  leading 2×2 Hankel minor (verified against the EXACT Gauss-period moments below).
* `hankel_psd_is_lower_bound`: the abstract one-sidedness — for any affine constraint
  `slope·t + C ≥ 0` with `slope > 0`, the feasible set is `t ≥ -C/slope`, a lower threshold;
  increasing `t` keeps it feasible, so it gives no upper bound.
* `realRoot_no_upper_bound_on_top`: the verdict — real-rootedness (PSD of the Hankel form)
  does NOT upper-bound the top power sum; the upper bound `E_r ≤ Wick` must come from the
  bounded SUPPORT (house `M` small = sub-iid right tail = the prize), not from real-rootedness.

The exact Gauss-period instance `p = 97, n = 16, f = 6` is recorded (`gaussPeriodMoments97`)
to anchor the affine law on the real object: `slope = p0·p2 - p1² = 6·81 - 1 = 485 > 0`.

**Honesty.**  This REDUCES the saddle (it is a no-go: it removes real-rootedness as a route to
the upper bound and pins the missing ingredient to a support/right-tail bound).  All theorems
are axiom-clean (`propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound`); no `sorry`/`native_decide`.

/-! ## The abstract one-sidedness of a positive-slope affine constraint -/

/-- **A positive-slope affine constraint is a LOWER bound.**  If `slope > 0` and the order-`r`
Hankel determinant is `slope·t + C`, then the PSD requirement `slope·t + C ≥ 0` holds for the
true top moment `t₀` AND for every `t ≥ t₀`.  Hence the constraint never bounds `t` from above:
raising the top power sum only makes the determinant more positive. -/

lower bound on `t` and never an upper bound. -/

/-! ## The exact Gauss-period anchor (`p = 97, n = 16, f = 6`)

The DISTINCT real conjugates `η_c` of `μ_16 ⊂ F_97^*` have the EXACT power sums (computed by
`/tmp/saddle_signs.py`, integer Newton from the period polynomial):

  `p0 = f = 6,  p1 = -1,  p2 = 81 (= p - n),  p3 = -256,  p4 = 2597.`

Hence the slope (leading `2×2` Hankel minor) is `p0·p2 - p1² = 6·81 - 1 = 485 > 0`, confirming
the determinant is strictly increasing in the top moment `p4` — the PSD constraint is a LOWER
bound on the energy ladder, exactly as the abstract law predicts. -/

/-- **The verdict for the saddle.**  At the exact Gauss-period moments, the order-2 Hankel
determinant equals `485 · p4 + C` with `C` fixed; since `485 > 0`, the real-rootedness /
moment-PSD constraint bounds the top power sum `p4` only from BELOW.  The required UPPER bound
`E_r ≤ Wick` is therefore invisible to real-rootedness and must come from a support / right-tail
(house) bound — the prize itself. -/

/-- **Real-rootedness does not upper-bound the top power sum.**  Packaged abstractly: if the
order-`r` Hankel determinant is affine `slope·t + C` in the top moment `t = E_r` with strictly
positive slope (the leading minor of a genuine real measure with `f > r` points), then for every
`U` there is a feasible `t > U`: no upper bound `E_r ≤ U` is implied by the moment-PSD
constraint alone.  (The prize upper bound `E_r ≤ Wick` must use the bounded support / sub-iid
right tail, not real-rootedness.) -/
