# Door-(iv) Lane 1/3: the negation symmetry `-1 ∈ μ_n` forces the worst-b sum REAL and the
# half-plane occupancy BALANCED — so the (dilation-NON-invariant) interval-occupancy feature is
# *also* b-blind, by a different mechanism than the dilation-invariance meta-theorem (#444)

## Context — closing a concrete worst-b selector

The campaign meta-theorem `_DoorIVPhaseSetDilationInvariant` proves that every fixed additive-linear
count of the phase set `S_b = {b·z : z ∈ μ_n}` is invariant under the nonzero dilation `b ↦ λ·b`,
hence **b-blind**: it cannot select the adversarial worst frequency. The natural escape is a feature
that genuinely BREAKS under dilation — the most basic being the position of the phase points relative
to a FIXED cut, i.e. the half-plane occupancy
`HP(b) = | #{z ∈ μ_n : (b·z mod p) ∈ [0, p/2)} − n/2 |`, equivalently the SIGN of the real parts of
`e_p(b·z)`. Dilation rotates the residues, so `HP` really does change with `b` — a legitimate
candidate selector outside the reach of the dilation-invariance meta-theorem.

## The probe verdict (`scripts/probes/probe_dooriv_worstb_halfplane_selector.py`)

PROPER thin 2-power `μ_n` (`n = 2^a`), prize regime `p ~ n^4 ≫ n^3`, n=16 FULL `𝔽_p^*` scan,
n=32,64 sampled; never `n = q−1`:

* `−1 ∈ μ_n` and `μ_n` is closed under `y ↦ −y` at every tested `n` (forced: `n` even ⟹ the
  unique order-`n` subgroup contains the order-2 element `−1`).
* consequently `max_b |Im η_b| ~ 1e-15` (float noise): **`η_b` is REAL for every `b`**.
* and `HP(b) = 0` for `99.98%` of all `b` (the `±1` cases are float-boundary): the half-plane
  occupancy is **exactly balanced** for every `b`, including the global argmax `b*`.
* hence `corr(HP, |η|) ≈ +0.05` and the argmax is *not* selected by `HP`.

## The mechanism (this file)

Both phenomena are one fact: `μ_n` is closed under negation, so the phase set
`{e_p(b·z) : z ∈ μ_n}` is closed under complex conjugation for every `b`. Pairing each point with its
conjugate:

* the imaginary parts cancel ⟹ the sum is real (`sum_isReal_of_conj_closed`);
* the upper-half-plane points pair bijectively with lower-half-plane points ⟹ occupancy is balanced
  (`upperHalf_card_eq_lowerHalf_card_of_conj_closed`).

So the dilation-NON-invariant interval-occupancy feature is **b-blind by the negation symmetry**, for a
reason orthogonal to the dilation-invariance meta-theorem. Any surviving door-(iv) worst-b selector
must therefore be invariant under neither dilation NOR conjugation — a strictly finer object than the
first-order real-part / half-plane sign data.

Scope: a finite multiset (`Finset`) of `ℂ` closed under `conj`. Definitional / pairing algebra. **No
CORE / cancellation / completion / moment / anti-concentration / capacity claim** — a refutation of a
concrete candidate selector with its mechanism, in the spirit of the campaign meta-theorem.

/-! ## Signed `b ↦ -b` symmetry of the worst-b sum (the increment over `_DoorIVWorstBCosetClosed`)

The in-tree fact (`_DoorIVWorstBCosetClosed`, DISPROOF_LOG `[door-iv-worstb-...]`) is that the
ABSOLUTE prize statistic `|η_b|` is invariant under `b ↦ -b`, because `η_{-b} = conj(η_b)` (negation-
closed `μ_n`) and `|conj w| = |w|`. Combined with `sum_isReal_of_conj_closed` above (`η_b` is REAL for
every `b`), the symmetry upgrades from the absolute value to the SIGNED value: a real number is its own
conjugate, so `η_{-b} = conj(η_b) = η_b` *exactly*. The two frequencies `b` and `-b` are therefore
interchangeable for the ENTIRE prize problem, not merely for `|η|`. -/

/-- **Signed `b ↦ -b` interchangeability.** If a frequency statistic `η : ι → ℂ` is REAL at `b`
(`conj (η b) = η b`, e.g. via `sum_isReal_of_conj_closed`) and the negation symmetry gives
`η (neg b) = conj (η b)` (the proven `η_{-b} = conj η_b`), then the SIGNED values coincide:
`η (neg b) = η b`. This strengthens the absolute-value `b↦-b` closure of the worst-b set
(`_DoorIVWorstBCosetClosed`) to a signed equality. -/
theorem signed_neg_symmetry {ι : Type*} (η : ι → ℂ) (b nb : ι)
    (hreal : (starRingEnd ℂ) (η b) = η b)
    (hneg : η nb = (starRingEnd ℂ) (η b)) :
    η nb = η b := by
  rw [hneg, hreal]

/-- The signed `b ↦ -b` symmetry, packaged for the conjugation-closed phase set: the real-ness comes
from `sum_isReal_of_conj_closed`, so the only remaining hypothesis is the proven negation relation
`η (neg b) = conj (η b)`. Consequently any frequency selector built on the SIGNED value (not just
`|η|`) is already `±b`-blind. -/
theorem signed_neg_symmetry_of_conjClosed {ι : Type*} (S : ι → Finset ℂ) (b nb : ι)
    (hS : ConjClosed (S b))

    (∑ z ∈ S nb, z) = ∑ z ∈ S b, z := by
  rw [hneg, sum_isReal_of_conj_closed hS]

/-- Predicate-level selector form of signed negation symmetry. Once `η nb = η b`, every selector that
only reads the signed complex value of the period is exactly `±b`-blind. This is the formal no-go used
by the probe verdict: even signed-value gates cannot distinguish the paired frequencies. -/

  rw [signed_neg_symmetry η b nb hreal hneg]

/-- Predicate-level selector form for conjugation-closed phase sets. Any threshold, sign test, or other
predicate applied to the signed period value is invariant under the paired frequencies `b` and `-b`,
provided the usual negation relation `η(-b)=conj(η(b))` holds. -/
