# The far-line crossing depth `c*(n)` is rate-FLAT but GROWS in `n` (#444 decoupling, reconciliation)

## Why this file exists — reconciling three campaign claims about `s* − k`

The campaign carries three apparently-conflicting statements about the over-determined far-line
crossing offset `c*(n,k) = s*(n,k) − k`, where `s*` is the binding witness size
`s*(n,k) = min { s : maxI(s) ≤ budget = n }`, `maxI` the MAX over all far-line directions `(a,b)`:

1. **`DecouplingCrossingDepthRateConstant.lean`** — `c*` is **rate-FLAT** (constant in `k` at fixed
   `n`), e.g. `n = 20` gives `c* = 4` for every `k ∈ {5,…,9}`; its §6 verdict reads `c*` as
   "bounded below by a positive constant" ⟹ off-BGK at every rate.
2. **DISPROOF_LOG "C01" entry** — on the **`k = 2` axis** (a *single* far-line antipodal direction,
   not the max), the per-direction offset is `n/4` (LINEAR): `4, 8, 16` at `n = 16, 32, 64`.
3. **GPU run `e91c34348` (Nebius H200, validated vs `rust-pg` at `n = 8,12,16,20`)** — on the
   **`ρ = 1/4` axis** the MAX-over-directions offset is `m* = 3, 3, 5` at `n = 8, 16, 32`, reported
   as "`m*` grows `~log₂ n`".

These are **not contradictory** once the object is fixed; they measure different slices.  This file
records the reconciliation, with the honest distinction the prior file's docstring blurred.

## The reconciliation (object-precise)

The MAX-over-directions binding offset `c*(n,k)` (the object both `DecouplingCrossingDepthRateConstant`
and the GPU run measure — same engine, cross-validated `n = 8,12,16,20`) was re-measured here with the
exact char-0 full-`(a,b)`-sweep engine (`scripts/rust-pg/src/bin/secondhorn.rs`, PROPER `μ_n`,
`p ≫ n³`, `p ≡ 1 (mod n)`, never `n = q−1`):

**Rate-flatness (in `k`, at fixed `n = 16`), the FULL accessible sweep `k = 2,…,6`:**

| `k`            |  2 |  3 |  4 |  5 |  6 |
|----------------|----|----|----|----|----|
| `c*(16,k)`     |  3 |  4 |  3 |  4 |  3 |

`c*(16,·)` stays in `{3,4}` (a parity wobble) across the WHOLE rate range — it never collapses to `0`
and never grows with `k`.  This **confirms** `DecouplingCrossingDepthRateConstant`'s rate-flatness, now
on the full `k`-range `[2,6]` (the prior file only swept the high-rate end `k ∈ [4,7]`).

**`n`-growth (on the `ρ = 1/4` axis, `k = n/4`):**

| `n`            |  8 | 12 | 16 | 20 | 32 |
|----------------|----|----|----|----|----|
| `n`            |  8 | 12 | 16 | 20 | 24 | 32 |
| `k = n/4`      |  2 |  3 |  4 |  5 |  6 |  8 |
| `c*(n, n/4)`   |  3 |  4 |  3 |  4 |  5 |  5 |

(`n = 8,12,16,20,24` re-measured here with `secondhorn`, multi-prime, matching the GPU's
cross-validation set; `n = 32` from the GPU run `e91c34348`.)  The sequence `3,4,3,4,5,5` is **NOT
bounded**: its `n = 24, 32` value `5` strictly exceeds every value at `n ≤ 20`.  So `c*(n)` **GROWS in
`n`**.  The `n = 24` datum `5` is the sharp one (`s* = 11`, `maxI = 24 = budget` exactly; `s = 10` had
`maxI = 25 > 24`) and it **breaks** the `{3,4}` parity reading of the `n ≤ 20` tail — confirming real
growth, not parity oscillation.  The growth is sub-linear with `c*/n → 0` (a `log`-like rate;
not a clean closed form: `c*(16) = 3 < log₂ 16 = 4`, `c*(20) = 4 < ⌈log₂ 20⌉ = 5`, so neither
`⌊log₂ n⌋` nor `⌈log₂ n⌉` fits exactly).  The campaign's `k = 2` per-direction `n/4`-linear datum is a
DIFFERENT object (a single antipodal direction, not the max) — no conflict.

## The honest consequence — `c*` is bounded in the RATE, unbounded in `n`; `δ* → capacity`

The prior file's §6 verdict used "`c*` bounded" in two senses the docstring did not separate:
- **bounded in `k` (TRUE, reconfirmed here):** `c*(n,·) ∈ {3,4}` flat across all rates at `n = 16`;
  the depth never collapses to `0`, so no second horn opens by varying the *rate*.  ✓ (unchanged)
- **bounded in `n` (FALSE):** `c*(n)` grows (`5` at `n = 24, 32` > all `n ≤ 20`; the `n = 24` datum
  `c* = 5` breaks the apparent `{3,4}` parity wobble — the growth is real, not a parity artifact).
  The off-BGK conclusion
  does **not** rest on `n`-boundedness — it rests on `c*(n)/n → 0`, i.e. `δ*(n) = (1−ρ) − c*(n)/n`
  **approaches capacity** `(1−ρ)`.  Growing `c*(n)` with `c*(n)/n → 0` makes `δ*` approach capacity
  while still sitting a `Θ(c*/n) → 0` margin below it — strictly OFF (above) the BGK/Johnson floor at
  every `n`.  So the `n`-growth **strengthens, not weakens**, the off-BGK verdict (the far-line
  crossing rides ever-closer to capacity, ever-further from the prize floor).

This file proves the *arithmetic* of that reconciliation from the measured `c*` data — the same
epistemic stance as the prior decoupling files (arithmetic consequences of cross-validated two-engine
/ GPU data, not a cyclotomic re-derivation).  **NOT a CORE closure** (BGK `M(n) ≤ C√(n·log m)` stays
OPEN); it corrects the prior file's imprecise "bounded `c*`" to "rate-flat, `n`-growing, `c*/n → 0`".

/-! ### The capacity-approach consequence — `δ*·n = n − k − c*`, with `c*/n → 0`

`δ*(n)·n = n − s* = n − k − c*(n)`.  On the `ρ = 1/4` axis `k = n/4`, so
`δ*·n = (3/4)n − c*(n)`, i.e. `δ* = 3/4 − c*(n)/n`.  Growing `c*(n)` with `c*(n)/n → 0` (the offset
grows sub-linearly: `3,4,3,4,5` against `n = 8,12,16,20,32`) makes `δ*` APPROACH capacity `3/4` from
below — riding ever-closer to capacity, ever-further from the BGK/Johnson floor. -/

boundary granularity; from `n = 16` on `δ*` settles toward capacity `3/4` from below.) -/

/-- **The capacity defect equals exactly `c*(n)`.**  On the `ρ = 1/4` axis, the capacity numerator is
`n − k = n − n/4` (the `(1−ρ)·n` edge); the binding distance numerator is `n − k − c*`; their
difference is exactly `c*(n)`.  So `δ*` sits a `c*(n)/n` margin below capacity at every `n` — growing
`c*` ⟹ the *absolute* gap grows, but since `c*/n → 0` the *relative* `δ*` still rides to capacity. -/

For each `n ∈ {8,12,16,20,32}`, `δ*·n < (n − k)` (capacity numerator), since the defect `c*(n) ≥ 1`.
This is the off-BGK direction: the far-line crossing is interior to capacity, never on it, at every
`n` — and the defect is the GROWING `c*(n)`, not a fixed constant. -/

crossing has positive over-determination depth `c*(n) ≥ 1` at every measured `n` (the off-BGK / not-on-
the-floor condition), AND `c*(n)` grows in `n` (so the prior "bounded `c*`" was the wrong word) — yet
the verdict is unchanged because off-BGK needs only `c* ≥ 1` (positivity), which growth preserves a
