# Char-0 backbone in the small-`r` (prize) regime: backbone ⟹ `T_r` increasing, end-to-end (#444)

`_CharZeroBackboneAntitone` proved the **sharp** char-0 backbone bound
```
        E_{r+1}(ℂ) ≤ (2r+1)·n · E_r(ℂ)      (from the Bessel deficit being antitone),
```
and, separately, `charZero_T_increasing_of_backbone`, which turns the **coarse** form
`E_{r+1} ≤ n²·E_r` into `T_r = n^{2r}/E_r` increasing (`= ` char-0 `ρ` antitone). The coarse form
was supplied there as a *hypothesis*; the bridge `(2r+1)n ≤ n²`, i.e. `2r+1 ≤ n`, was not composed.

**This file: the regime-explicit composition.** The bridge `(2r+1)·n ≤ n²` holds exactly when
`2r+1 ≤ n` (`1 ≤ n`). The prize saddle sits at `r ≈ β·log₂ n` (probe: `scripts/probes` β≈4.5), which
for every prize-regime `n = 2^a` is *comfortably inside* `2r+1 ≤ n` (e.g. `n=2^20`: saddle `r≈90`,
regime bound `(n−1)/2 ≈ 5.2·10^5`). So the sharp backbone, in the regime that the prize lives in,
**implies the coarse form unconditionally**, and hence the char-0 `T_r`-increasing / `ρ`-antitone half:

```
   sharp backbone   E_{r+1} ≤ (2r+1)n·E_r
   regime           2r+1 ≤ n,  0 ≤ E_r
   ───────────────────────────────────────  ⟹  E_{r+1} ≤ n²·E_r  ⟹  n^{2r}/E_r ≤ n^{2(r+1)}/E_{r+1}.
```

**What this file proves (axiom-clean).**
* `coarse_backbone_of_sharp_smallR` — the bridge: sharp backbone `E_{r+1} ≤ (2r+1)n·E_r` + `2r+1 ≤ n`
  + `1 ≤ n` + `0 ≤ E_r` ⟹ coarse backbone `E_{r+1} ≤ n²·E_r`.
* `charZero_T_increasing_of_sharp_smallR` — the end-to-end composition: sharp backbone + small-`r`
  regime ⟹ `n^{2r}/E_r ≤ n^{2(r+1)}/E_{r+1}` (`T_r` increasing = char-0 `ρ` antitone), with the
  coarse `n²` hypothesis **discharged** (no longer assumed).
* `charZero_T_increasing_of_deficit_smallR` — the *fully reduced* form: from `E = Wick·d`, the Wick
  recursion, deficit-antitone `d(r+1) ≤ d(r)`, and `2r+1 ≤ n`, conclude `T_r` increasing — chaining the
  backbone derivation (`_CharZeroBackboneAntitone.energy_ratio_le_of_deficit_antitone`, re-proved inline
  to keep this file standalone) all the way to the char-0 `ρ`-antitone step from the deficit anchor alone.

**Honest scope.** Char-0 ONLY. This packages the char-0 half of the antitone race end-to-end in the
prize regime; the char-p correction `S_r − (p−1)E_r = p·W_r` staying within the backbone room at the
saddle remains the open prize. No CORE upper bound, no capacity/growth-law claim. Issue #444.

`E_{r+1} ≤ (2r+1)·n·E_r` implies the coarse backbone `E_{r+1} ≤ n²·E_r`, since `(2r+1)·n ≤ n·n = n²`. -/
