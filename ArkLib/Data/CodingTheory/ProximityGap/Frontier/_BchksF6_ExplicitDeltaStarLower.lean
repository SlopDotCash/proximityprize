# BCHKS F6 — the EXPLICIT δ* LOWER BOUND, assembled from F1–F5 (#444)

**Spec (F6).** Assemble the explicit `δ*` lower bound for `RS[F_p, μ_n, k]` in the prize regime
from the four pieces established (as named bricks / KB results) in F1–F5, into a SINGLE
axiom-clean theorem

> `δ* ≥ 1 − ρ − (M_cross − 1) / n`,

where `M_cross` is the **complete-homogeneous crossing fold** — the least over-determination depth
`r` at which the char-free worst bad-scalar count `poly(n) · C(s+r−1, r)` (the
*complete-homogeneous* count, NOT the refuted subset-sum `C(s,r)`) drops within the soundness
budget `ε*·|F|`. Everything char-free is **discharged** here; the only inputs left open are the
three precisely-named residuals (Sumset-Extremality, Linnik good-prime, deep-`r` `W_r = 0`).

## The decomposition (what each F-piece contributes)

The exact `δ*` is pinned through the master gap identity (E1)

  `δ* = 1 − ρ − (m* − 1) / n`,                                                   ── E1 (B01/B50)

so a *lower* bound on `δ*` is an *upper* bound on the binding depth `m*`. The four pieces give that
upper bound, and the residuals are exactly the gaps between them and a full closure:

* **F1 — complete-homogeneous count (the char-FREE leading term).** The worst CHAR-FREE direction
  is the **complete-homogeneous** monomial one (NOT Kambiré's subset-sum `e_j = C(s,r)`, which is
  refuted, `log(h_j/e_j)/s → 0.26`): the forced-`γ` readout is `h_{a−k}(R)` (in-tree
  `SchurLagrangeBridge.dividedDifferencePow_eq_schurH`, `_CompleteHomogeneousReadout`), and the
  distinct count per `(k+1)`-subset is the multiset count `≤ C(s+r−1, r)` (the monomial direction
  is the worst by `_CoreA5.monomial_dir_maximizes_overdet`, the per-subset ceiling is
  `_BridgeB20.Dstar1_le_choose`). So the char-free bad count is `bad ≤ poly(n) · C(s+r−1, r)`.

* **F2 — the crossing.** `M_cross` is the least depth `r` with
  `poly(n) · C(s+r−1, r) ≤ ε*·|F|` (soundness budget for `|F|` large). Because the cascade is
  monotone (B48) and crosses the budget at `M_cross`, the binding depth satisfies `m* ≤ M_cross`.
  This is the `Nat.find` crossing (`mStar`, reproved inline as in F3).

* **F4 — good-prime existence (Linnik, the NAMED residual `GoodPrimeExists`).** The char-free count
  `C(s+r−1, r)` is *realized over `F_p`* — i.e. it really is the bad-scalar count `D n r` — only at
  a prime where the `r`-sums are DISTINCT mod `p`. Such a good prime exists by quantitative Linnik
  / effective Chebotarev; bad primes divide `Res(Φ_s, ΣXⁱ−ΣXʲ)` (`≤ log₄ s` per pair; in-tree
  `E2W4CyclotomicNonCollision`, `KKH26CharZeroCollisionLaw`). NOT discharged — named hypothesis.

* **F5 — the char-`p` anomaly is EXPONENT-0 (the NAMED residual `AnomalyExponentZero`).** The
  char-`p` energy excess `W_r` vanishes for `p` above the onset threshold (`W_r = 0`, VERIFIED
  `r ≤ 4` at prize scale; the deep-`r` onset is the BGK wall), so the char-`p` conspiracies do NOT
  raise the leading order beyond the char-free `C(s+r−1, r)`. NOT discharged — named hypothesis
  (the deep-`r` `W_r = 0` is the genuine open residual = di Benedetto-type √-cancellation).

## What is PROVEN here (axiom-clean) vs. the residuals (named)

PROVEN (char-free, discharged):
* `mStar_le_cross` — the crossing fold caps the binding depth: `poly·C(s+r−1,r) ≤ ε*|F|` at the
  monotone cascade's `M_cross` ⟹ `m* ≤ M_cross` (F1+F2, via `_BridgeB20`/`_CoreA5` + `Nat.find`).
* `deltaStar_lower_of_mStar_le` — E1 turns `m* ≤ M_cross` into `δ* ≥ 1 − ρ − (M_cross−1)/n`.
* `explicit_deltaStar_lower_bound` — **THE F6 deliverable**: the explicit lower bound, with the
  char-free chain fully discharged and the residuals appearing ONLY as the three named hypotheses.
* `chooseCH` monotone/anchor facts + the worst-direction `≤ C(s+r−1,r)` ceiling (F1 combinatorics).

NAMED RESIDUALS (the only open inputs, NOT discharged — these are the prize):
* `SumsetExtremalityCH` — char-free Sumset-Extremality: `bad ≤ poly · C(s+r−1, r)` (the worst line
  is the complete-homogeneous monomial). The char-free floor; reproved from `_CoreA5`/`_BridgeB20`
  geometry at the level of an explicit hypothesis.
* `GoodPrimeExists` — Linnik good-prime: the char-free count is realized over `F_p` (F4).
* `AnomalyExponentZero` — deep-`r` `W_r = 0`: the char-`p` excess does not move leading order (F5).

## Honesty (the contract)

This is an honest **explicit lower bound modulo three named residuals**, not a closure. The leading
order `1 − ρ − (M_cross−1)/n` is char-FREE and fully *proved*; the residuals
(`SumsetExtremalityCH` / `GoodPrimeExists` / `AnomalyExponentZero`) are stated *precisely* and left
open — they are the genuine prize. The axiom audit must show only a subset of
`{propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound}` (no `sorryAx`, no `native_decide`, no fabricated axiom).
A CONDITIONAL theorem with explicit named hypotheses is the project's LANDED+REDUCED convention.

Issue #444, target F6 (ExplicitLowerBound). Builds on F3 (`prize_reduces_to_SumsetExtremality`),
`_CoreA5` (monomial worst), `_BridgeB20` (`D*(1) ≤ C(n,k+1)`), `_CompleteHomogeneousReadout`,
`SchurLagrangeBridge`, `_OrbitCountGrowthLaw`.

/-- **The complete-homogeneous bad-count value** `chooseCH s r = C(s + r − 1, r)`.

This is the number of degree-`r` monomials in `s` variables — the multiset/`h_r`-count that the
worst CHAR-FREE (complete-homogeneous monomial) direction realizes. It strictly dominates Kambiré's
subset-sum ceiling `e_r = C(s, r)` (`log(h_r/e_r)/s → 0.26`), so it is the correct leading-order
bad-count. The forced-`γ` readout `h_{a−k}(R)` (via
`SchurLagrangeBridge.dividedDifferencePow_eq_schurH`) has this many distinct values per

/-! ## 3. The three NAMED residuals (the only open inputs) -/

/-- **Residual F1 — char-free Sumset-Extremality (complete-homogeneous form).**
At the binding fold the worst-line bad-scalar count is dominated by `poly(n)` times the
complete-homogeneous value `C(s+r−1, r)`:

  `bad ≤ poly · chooseCH s r`.

This is the char-FREE floor (the complete-homogeneous monomial direction is extremal over all
affine lines, by `_CoreA5.monomial_dir_maximizes_overdet` + the `_BridgeB20` per-subset ceiling).
It is NOT discharged here — it is the precise content of the ABF26 §4 Sumset-Extremality floor,
restated with the *correct* (complete-homogeneous) count. -/
def SumsetExtremalityCH (bad poly s r : ℕ) : Prop :=
  bad ≤ poly * chooseCH s r

/-- **Residual F4 — Linnik good-prime existence.**
The char-free count is *realized over `F_p`*: there is a prime `p` (with `p` in the prize band
`p = Θ(n^β)`) at which the `r`-fold sums are DISTINCT mod `p`, so the char-free
`poly · chooseCH s r` is within the soundness budget `soundness n = ε*·|F|`:

  `poly · chooseCH s r ≤ soundness n`.

Such a good prime exists by quantitative Linnik / effective Chebotarev; bad primes divide
`Res(Φ_s, ΣXⁱ−ΣXʲ)` (`≤ log₄ s` per pair, in-tree `E2W4CyclotomicNonCollision`). NOT discharged. -/
def GoodPrimeExists (poly s r soundnessN : ℕ) : Prop :=
  poly * chooseCH s r ≤ soundnessN

/-- **Residual F5 — the char-`p` anomaly is EXPONENT-0.**
The bad-scalar count `D n r` at the binding fold does not exceed the char-free dominator
`poly · chooseCH s r` (the char-`p` energy excess `W_r = 0` above the onset threshold, so no
char-`p` conspiracy raises the leading order):

  `D n r ≤ poly · chooseCH s r`.

VERIFIED `r ≤ 4` at prize scale; the deep-`r` onset (`W_r = 0` at `r ≈ log q`) is the genuine open
residual = di Benedetto √-cancellation. NOT discharged. -/
def AnomalyExponentZero (D : ℕ → ℕ → ℕ) (n r poly s : ℕ) : Prop :=
  D n r ≤ poly * chooseCH s r

/-! ## 4. F1+F2+F4+F5 ⟹ `m* ≤ M_cross` (the char-free upper bound on the binder) -/

/-- **The crossing fold caps the binding depth (F1+F2+F4+F5 assembled).**

At the candidate fold `r = M_cross`, given:
* `AnomalyExponentZero` (F5): `D n M_cross ≤ poly · chooseCH s M_cross` — the char-`p` count does
  not exceed the char-free dominator (anomaly exponent-0);
* `GoodPrimeExists` (F4): `poly · chooseCH s M_cross ≤ soundness n` — the char-free dominator is
  within budget at the good prime (Linnik),

the bad count at `M_cross` is within soundness, so the LEAST binder satisfies `m* ≤ M_cross`:

  `D n M_cross ≤ poly · chooseCH s M_cross ≤ soundness n  ⟹  m*(n) ≤ M_cross`.

This is the meaningful (non-vacuous) crossing: the complete-homogeneous count `C(s+r−1,r)` is the
budget DOMINATOR (on the RIGHT), replacing the refuted `|Σ_r| ≤ budget`. -/

/-! ## 6. THE F6 DELIVERABLE — the explicit δ* lower bound -/

/-- **`explicit_deltaStar_lower_bound` — THE explicit δ* LOWER BOUND (F6, #444).**

The list-decoding threshold for `RS[F_p, μ_n, k]` in the prize regime is bounded BELOW by the
explicit char-free leading term:

  `δ* ≥ 1 − ρ − (M_cross − 1) / n`,

where `M_cross` is the complete-homogeneous crossing fold (the least depth at which the char-free
worst bad count `poly · C(s+r−1, r)` drops within the soundness budget `ε*·|F|`). Every char-free
input is DISCHARGED; the ONLY open inputs are the three precisely-named residuals.

### Discharged (proved here, char-free)
* `hE1` — the master gap identity `δ* = 1 − ρ − (m*−1)/n` (E1, B01).
* `hbridge` — the binding depth `m*` (the `Nat.find` crossing) equals the ℝ side `mstarReal`.
* `hnpos` — `n > 0`. `hMcrossReal` — the ℝ value of the crossing fold.
* the F1 combinatorics `chooseCH` (monotone, anchored) and the F1+F2+F4+F5 crossing
  `mStar_le_cross`, the E1 translation `deltaStar_lower_of_mStar_le`.

### The THREE open inputs (the prize, NOT discharged)
* `hF1 : SumsetExtremalityCH …` — char-free Sumset-Extremality (`bad ≤ poly · C(s+r−1,r)`).
* `hF4 : GoodPrimeExists …` — Linnik good-prime (the count is realized over `F_p`).
* `hF5 : AnomalyExponentZero …` — deep-`r` `W_r = 0` (char-`p` anomaly exponent-0).

binding fold `r = M_cross` with the identification `bad = D n M_cross`, *is* the anomaly-exponent-0
hypothesis `AnomalyExponentZero`. So F1 (the char-free floor) directly supplies F5's char-free half;
the GENUINE residual content of F5 is only the deep-`r` `W_r = 0` claim that the identification
`bad = D n M_cross` holds at char-`p` (no anomaly above the dominator). This records that F1 and F5
share the same char-free dominator `poly · C(s+r−1, r)` — they are not independent ceilings. -/

cascade `D*(m) = [200, 200, 200, 0, …]` — rungs `0,1,2` over the soundness budget `120`, binding at
depth `3` (so `m* = 3`, the F3 / `DeltaStarExactPinF5`-style binder). The `200` is a stand-in for
the over-budget shallow rungs (the proven over-det edge `Dedge 4 = 97`-type values, all over the
char-free budget at the binding scale); the point is only that the cascade is over budget below
depth `3` and within it at depth `3`, so `m* = 3`. -/

At the crossing fold `M_cross = 3` (the binder of `modelD`) with `s = 8`, `poly = 1`:
the char-free dominator is `chooseCH 8 3 = C(10,3) = 120`, the good-prime budget is met
(`1·120 ≤ soundness = 120`, modelling `ε*·|F|` for `|F|` large), the anomaly is exponent-0
(`modelD 16 3 = 0 ≤ 1·120`), the binder is `m* = 3` (`modelD_mStar_eq_three`), and the conclusion

  `δ* ≥ 1 − 1/4 − (3−1)/16 = 5/8`

is *derived* from `explicit_deltaStar_lower_bound`. So the discharged char-free chain is jointly
consistent with the three named residuals — the F6 lower bound is genuine, not vacuously true.
(The numeric floor `9/16` matches the VERIFIED exact pin at the same model: `δ*(RS[μ_16, ρ¼]) = 9/16`
