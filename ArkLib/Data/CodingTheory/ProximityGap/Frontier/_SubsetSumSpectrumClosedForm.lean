# The char-0 subset-sum spectrum of the 2-power subgroup: exact closed form (#444)

For the 2-power subgroup `μ_n` (`n = 2^μ`, the `n`-th roots of unity), the **depth-`r` subset-sum spectrum
cardinality** is `N_r(ℂ) = |{ Σ_{z∈S} z : S ⊆ μ_n, |S| = r }|` (distinct complex subset sums). By the
in-tree `DeepBandSubsetSumSpectrum.witness_pin` (each deep-band bad scalar is `γ_S = −Σ_{z∈S} z`), this is
exactly the **deep-band bad-scalar count `#bad_r`** whose growth law is the master open δ\* question.

**Exact closed form (this session, verified exact at `n = 8, 16` against the spectrum probe).** Via the
antipodal cross-polytope reduction (`ζ^a ↦ ±e_{a mod m}`, `m = n/2`; the only relation among `2^μ`-th roots
is `ζ^{a+m} = −ζ^a`), a size-`r` subset's sum is determined by its net vector `v ∈ {−1,0,1}^m`: a vector
with `k` nonzero entries uses `k` elements (the `±1`'s) plus pairs (each absorbing 2 elements with net 0),
so `|S| = r` is achievable iff `k ≡ r (mod 2)` and `k ≤ min(r, 2m−r)`, and there are `C(m,k)·2^k` such
vectors. Hence
```
N_r(ℂ) = Σ_{k ≡ r (mod 2),  0 ≤ k ≤ min(r, 2m−r)}  C(m, k) · 2^k.
```
This **matches 0xSolace's `spectsym` probe exactly** — `n=8`: `[1,8,25,40,41,40,25,8,1]`; `n=16`: the
palindrome up to `3281`. It extends `spectsym` from the *symmetry* `N_r = N_{n−r}` (proven there
structurally) to the *exact count*.

This file defines the closed-form `spectrumCount m r` and proves:
- the **palindrome** `spectrumCount m r = spectrumCount m (2m − r)` (`0xSolace`'s `spectsym`, here for the
  closed form — nearly definitional: `min(r,2m−r)` and the parity class are both `r ↔ 2m−r` symmetric);
- the verified small values (`m = 4`: `1,8,25,40,41,…`).

**HONESTY.** `N_r(F_p) = N_r(ℂ) = spectrumCount` holds only in the **dilute** regime `N_r(ℂ) ≪ p`. At the
prize-binding depth `r = ρn+1` the char-0 count is exponential, `≫ p`, so the `F_p` spectrum is
collision-saturated and `p`-dependent (the BGK/BCHKS wall). The bridge `N_r(ℂ) = spectrumCount` is the cited
antipodal/cyclotomic result (same status as `_CharZeroEnergyClosedForm`). Issue #444.

/-- **The char-0 subset-sum spectrum closed form.** `spectrumCount m r = Σ_{k≡r(2), k≤min(r,2m−r)} C(m,k)·2^k`

range bound `min(r, 2m−r)` and the parity class `k ≡ r (mod 2)` are invariant under `r ↦ 2m−r` (since `2m`
is even), so the two sums are over the *same* index set. -/
