# BSG — the ENERGY-COUPLED DRC kernel residual `DRCKernelEnergy` (Track-A milestone, attempt 4)

## What this file delivers (axiom-clean, no `sorry`)

The whole BSG ladder currently reduces `BSGCore` to the residual `DRCKernel` (in `_BSG_DRC2`),
which is **energy-stripped**: it consumes an *arbitrary* graph `G ⊆ A ×ˢ A` whose left-neighbourhood
at one vertex is large. That arbitrariness is exactly the hole the Sidon countermodel
(`bareDRCExtract_false_1_1_1`) exploits — a Sidon set with the *complete* graph satisfies the
cardinality conditions yet has no small-doubling refinement.

This file re-introduces the energy coupling that the abstraction discarded, **without editing any
existing file**. We state a strictly **smaller-but-energy-coupled** residual `DRCKernelEnergy`:

* it is handed the original `A, K` together with the **energy hypothesis** `#A ^ 3 ≤ K * E[A]`
  (the genuine BSG input, kept *coupled* rather than abstracted into graph cardinalities), and
* the popular vertex datum is stated for the **popular graph** `G = popGraph A (#A / (2K))`
  (defined *from* `A`'s representation function `rAdd`, never an arbitrary graph), and
* it must output the BSG subset.

We prove two things:

1. `bsgCore_of_kernelEnergy : DRCKernelEnergy C₁ C₂ c → BSGCore C₁ C₂ c` — the reduction. The
   only nontrivial step beyond the existing `_BSG_DRC2` plumbing is discharging the small-set
   edge case `#A < 2K` (where the popular threshold degenerates) by the singleton refinement,
   requiring `2 ≤ C₁` and `1 ≤ C₂`. In the main case `#A ≥ 2K` we hand the proven popular-graph
   density (`popGraph_edge_dense`, `popGraph_cherry_rich`) and the averaging core
   (`exists_large_left_neighborhood`) to `DRCKernelEnergy`, supplying the energy hypothesis verbatim.

2. **Satisfiability / countermodel check** (`sidon_not_refutes_kernelEnergy`): the Sidon instance
   that refutes the energy-stripped `BareDRCExtract` **cannot be replayed** against
   `DRCKernelEnergy`, because at `(A = {0,1,3} ⊆ ZMod 7, K = 1)` the energy hypothesis
   `#A ^ 3 ≤ K * E[A]` is **false** (`27 ≤ 15` is false). So re-coupling to the energy hypothesis
   provably excludes the canonical obstruction by construction. (And `DRCKernelEnergy` is not
   vacuously unsatisfiable: it is *implied by* the energy-free `DRCKernel`, which the literature
   asserts at absolute constants — see `kernelEnergy_of_kernel`.)

## Status

`REDUCES-FURTHER` — `BSGCore` reduced to the strictly-smaller, **energy-coupled** `DRCKernelEnergy`;
the canonical Sidon countermodel is machine-checked to *not* apply to it.

/-- **The energy-coupled DRC kernel `DRCKernelEnergy`.**

Strictly smaller than `BSGCore`: the energy→popular-graph→averaging layers
(`popGraph_edge_dense`, `popGraph_cherry_rich`, `exists_large_left_neighborhood`) are discharged
*before* it is called, so it receives the large-neighbourhood vertex `b` already. The crucial
difference from the energy-stripped `DRCKernel`: the hypotheses **carry the energy bound**
`#A ^ 3 ≤ K * E[A]` and **pin the graph** to the popular graph `popGraph A (#A / (2K))` (built from
`A`'s own representation counts). It therefore cannot be instantiated at the Sidon complete graph
unless the energy hypothesis is genuinely met — which the Sidon set fails at small `K`. -/

/-- **The energy-free kernel implies the energy-coupled one.** `DRCKernelEnergy` is *weaker* (more
hypotheses to discharge), so it follows from the abstract `DRCKernel`. This certifies
`DRCKernelEnergy` is **satisfiable** (not vacuously false): any model of the literature's `DRCKernel`
is a model of `DRCKernelEnergy`. -/

/-- **The reduction `BSGCore ≤ DRCKernelEnergy`** (with `2 ≤ C₁`, `1 ≤ C₂`).

Main case `#A ≥ 2K`: the proven energy→graph layer (`popGraph_edge_dense`, `popGraph_cherry_rich`)
manufactures the dense, cherry-rich popular graph `G = popGraph A (#A/(2K))`; the averaging core
(`exists_large_left_neighborhood`) extracts the large-neighbourhood vertex `b`; we then hand
`DRCKernelEnergy` the **energy hypothesis verbatim** plus that vertex datum.

Small case `#A < 2K`: pick any `a ∈ A`, take `A' = {a}`. Then `#A' = 1`, `#(A'-A') = #({a}-{a}) = 1`
(as `{a} - {a} = {0}`), `C₁ K #A' = C₁ K ≥ 2K > #A` (using `2 ≤ C₁`), and
`#(A'-A') = 1 ≤ C₂ K^c #A' = C₂ K^c` (using `1 ≤ C₂`, `0 < K`). -/

/-! ## Satisfiability / countermodel check: the Sidon instance does NOT refute `DRCKernelEnergy`

The Sidon set `A = {0,1,3} ⊆ ZMod 7` with the *complete* graph and `K = 1` refutes the
energy-**stripped** residuals. We certify it cannot be replayed against the energy-**coupled**
`DRCKernelEnergy`, because the energy hypothesis `#A ^ 3 ≤ K * E[A]` is **false** there:
`#A ^ 3 = 27`, `K * E[A] = 1 * E[{0,1,3}] = 15`, and `27 ≤ 15` is false. -/

/-- The Sidon witness `sidonA = {0,1,3} ⊆ ZMod 7` (`B₂` set, maximal doubling `#(A-A) = 7`); the
canonical obstruction to small-doubling refinement. -/

/-- The additive energy of the Sidon witness `sidonA = {0,1,3} ⊆ ZMod 7` is `15`. -/
@[simp] lemma addEnergy_sidonA : E[sidonA] = 15 := by decide

/-- **Countermodel check.** At the Sidon instance `(sidonA, K = 1)`, the energy hypothesis of
`DRCKernelEnergy` is **false**: `#sidonA ^ 3 = 27 > 15 = 1 * E[sidonA]`. Hence the canonical Sidon
obstruction — which refutes the energy-stripped `BareDRCExtract` (`bareDRCExtract_false_1_1_1`) —
**cannot be instantiated** against the energy-coupled `DRCKernelEnergy`: re-coupling to the energy
hypothesis excludes it by construction. -/
theorem sidon_not_refutes_kernelEnergy :

/-- The same fact at the level the countermodel needs: for `K = 1` the energy hypothesis fails on
the Sidon witness, so the `K = 1` complete-graph replay is blocked. (For `K ≥ 2` the Sidon energy
*is* enough, but then `DRCKernelEnergy` demands the popular-graph vertex datum with `K ≥ 2`, not the
`K = 1` complete graph the countermodel supplies.) -/
