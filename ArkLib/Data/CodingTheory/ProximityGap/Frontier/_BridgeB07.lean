# Bridge B07 — target E6: the EXACT FFT-graded dyadic recursion (#444)

This file gives a *faithful Lean transcription* of the empirical object E6 from
`docs/kb/deltastar-444-empirical-formulas-and-bridges-2026-06-15.md`, matching
`scripts/probes/probe_2adic_tower_recursion.py` line-for-line, and proves what is
elementary while isolating the one combinatorial bijection as a precisely named gap.

## The object (matching the probe exactly)

For `n` even, `h = n/2`. For a finite multiset / set of "frequencies" `A ⊆ ℤ/n`, a
chosen grade `m`, the graded vector is
`fhat A m n : Fin h → ℤ`,  `(fhat A m n) (e % h) += (if e < h then 1 else -1)` where
`e = (m * a) % n`, summed over `a ∈ A`.  (This is the `n/2`-binned graded FFT
coefficient of the indicator of `A`.)

`#bad_n(k,m) := cf n k m :=` the number of *distinct nonzero* values of
`fhat A m n` over all `(k+m)`-subsets `A ⊆ {0,…,n-1}` such that `fhat A j n = 0`
for every `1 ≤ j < m` (all lower graded pieces vanish).

## E6 (verified exactly at 16↔8, ALL HOLD)

* `cf (2n) k (2*m') = cf n (k/2) m'`        (the even-grade doubling recursion)
* `cf (2n) k m = 0` for `m` odd            (antipodal odd-vanishing)

## What this file does (honesty contract)

* Defines `fhat`, `gradedZeroLower`, the bad-value finset `badVals`, and `cf`
  faithfully (transcribing the probe), over `ℤ` with explicit `%` arithmetic.
* Proves the *trivial-grade base fact* and the *finiteness / well-definedness*
  scaffolding axiom-clean.
* Reduces the two E6 equalities to two precisely named Props
  (`DoublingBijection`, `OddGradeVanishes`) and proves the recursion *from* them.
  These two Props are the genuine combinatorial content (a value-preserving
  doubling bijection of subsets, and an antipodal-involution vanishing); they are
  the honest remaining gap, stated precisely as hypotheses.

Issue #444. Target E6.

Matches `fhat`'s inner loop in the probe. -/

/-! ## The two named combinatorial gaps (the genuine content of E6) -/

/-- **The doubling bijection (gap, even half).** There is a value-set bijection between the
bad graded values at level `2n`, grade `2m'`, capacity `k`, and those at level `n`, grade `m'`,
capacity `k/2`. (Probe `cf(2n,k,2m') = cf(n,k/2,m')`, "ALL HOLD".) Stated as the cardinality
identity it directly governs `cf`. -/
def DoublingBijection : Prop :=
  ∀ n k m' : ℕ, cf (2 * n) k (2 * m') = cf n (k / 2) m'

/-- **Antipodal odd-vanishing (gap, odd half).** At even level `2n`, every odd grade has empty
bad-value set (the antipodal `-1 ∈ μ_{2n}` forces the odd graded piece to vanish whenever the
lower pieces do). (Probe `cf(2n,k,odd)=0`.) -/
