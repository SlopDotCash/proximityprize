# ANGLE L4 — Dissociativity / quasi-independence: the Rudin √q route, and its defect (#444)

The prize floor `M = max_{b≠0}|η_b| ≤ C·√(n·log m)` is the **Λ(q) inequality** `‖η‖_q ≤ C·√q·√n`
for the frequency set `μ_n` (`η_b = Σ_{x∈μ_n} ψ(b·x)` on `F_p`). This file attacks it through the
sharpest classical sufficient condition for a Λ(q)-bound with the *correct* constant `√q`:
**DISSOCIATIVITY** (= quasi-independence).

## The dissociativity dictionary (the load-bearing definitions)

A finite subset `S = {s₁,…,s_N}` of an abelian group is **dissociated** if the only solution of
`Σ_{i} ε_i s_i = 0` with `ε_i ∈ {−1,0,+1}` is the trivial `ε ≡ 0` — equivalently, all `3^N`
signed subset-sums `Σ ε_i s_i` are DISTINCT. (Hadamard-lacunary sets `{2^j}` are the model
example.) Dissociated ⟹ **Rudin's inequality** with the optimal constant: for every even integer
`q = 2k`,
> `‖Σ_i a_i χ_{s_i}‖_{L^q} ≤ √q · ‖a‖_{ℓ²}`,
i.e. the signed/Rademacher chaos is sub-Gaussian with constant `√q`, EXACTLY the prize exponent
`1/2` (no `o(1)` loss, `p`-independent). This is the strongest possible structural input: a
dissociated frequency support gives the prize floor on the nose.

## Why `μ_n` is FAR from dissociated — and the exact defect

`μ_n` is a **multiplicative group**, hence stuffed with `±1` additive relations:

* **Antipodal (the first defect).** `μ_n ∋ −1 = ω^{n/2}`, so for EVERY `x ∈ μ_n` we have the
  signed relation `x + (−x) = 0` with `ε = (+1,…,−1,…)` nontrivial. That is `n/2` independent
  2-term `±1` relations — `μ_n` fails dissociativity already at sub-sum length 2.
* **Higher relations (the deep defect).** Every additive coincidence `Σ_{x∈A} x = Σ_{y∈B} y`
  with `A,B ⊆ μ_n` disjoint is a `±1` relation `Σ_A x − Σ_B y = 0`. The COUNT of such relations
  among `k`-element multisets is exactly the additive energy `E_k(μ_n) − (#trivial)`, which is
  what governs the Λ(2k) constant.

So the **dissociativity defect** of `μ_n` — the number of nontrivial `±1` sub-sum relations of
length `≤ 2k` — is *identically* the relation count whose generating series is the energy
`E_k(μ_n)`. There is no slack: the defect IS the energy.

## The defect-bounded version that WOULD suffice (the honest reduction)

Rudin's theorem does not need *full* dissociativity; a quantitative version holds for sets with
**bounded dissociativity defect**: if among every `k`-tuple the number of nontrivial `±1`
relations is `≤ D_k`, then the Λ(2k) constant inflates by `(1 + D_k/Wick_k)^{1/2k}`. The
prize-floor exponent `1/2` survives iff
> `D_k ≤ C^k · Wick_k = C^k·(2k−1)‼·n^k`  for all `k` up to the saddle `k ≈ ln p`.
But `D_k = E_k(μ_n) − Wick_k` is precisely the **char-`p` wraparound excess** `W_k` of
`_RudinLambdaQNoBypass` / `GaussianEnergyBound`. The char-0 part (only diagonal matchings survive
on the circle) is the in-tree Lam–Leung bound `E_k^{c0} ≤ Wick_k`; the deep-`k` char-`p` surplus
is the open BGK content.

## What this file proves (axiom-clean, honest)

* `dissociated_lambdaQ_sub_gaussian` — the Rudin skeleton, abstracted to the load-bearing
  inequality: a dissociated frequency support gives the sub-Gaussian Λ(2k) moment bound
  `‖η‖_{2k}^{2k} ≤ (√(2k))^{2k}·‖a‖_2^{2k}`, with the prize exponent `1/2`. Proved from the
  hypothesis that the only `±1` relations are diagonal (`hdiss`), packaged so the constant is
  literally `√(2k)`.
* `defect_eq_energy_excess` — the **headline reduction**: the dissociativity defect
  `D_k := E_k − Wick_k` equals the char-`p` excess `W_k`; quasi-independence-with-defect-`D_k`
  ⟺ energy-with-excess-`W_k`. The two viewpoints are term-for-term identical.
* `defect_bounded_lambdaQ` — the defect-bounded sufficient condition: if `D_k ≤ C^k·Wick_k`
  then `E_k ≤ (1+C^k)·Wick_k` and the Λ(2k) constant stays `O(√k)`. The open input is exactly
  `D_k ≤ C^k·Wick_k` (= the deep-`k` multiplicative deviation = BGK).
* `antipodal_breaks_dissociation` — the exact first defect: `μ_n` has `n/2 ≥ 1` antipodal
  2-term `±1` relations (`x + (−x) = 0`), so it is NOT dissociated; the dissociativity route
  cannot be applied verbatim and MUST be the defect-bounded version.

**Verdict: REDUCED.** Dissociativity gives the prize floor with the correct `√q` constant, but
`μ_n` (a group, antipodal) is not dissociated; the quantitative defect-bounded version reduces
the prize to bounding the dissociativity defect `D_k = E_k − Wick_k = W_k`, which is the SAME
char-`p` wraparound excess at the saddle `k ≈ ln p` as `GaussianEnergyBound` /
`_RudinLambdaQNoBypass`. The defect = the relations = the energy: no new slack, the open part is
named (deep-`k` multiplicative deviation = BGK resonance). Axiom-clean
(`propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound`). Issue #444.

/-- **The Rudin sub-Gaussian skeleton for a dissociated support.** Abstracting Rudin's theorem to
its load-bearing inequality: if the `2k`-fold energy `Ek` of the frequency support equals its
diagonal (Wick) value `Wick = (2k−1)‼·n^k` — i.e. the ONLY `±1` sub-sum relations are the trivial
diagonal matchings, the definition of dissociated-at-order-`k` — then the `L^{2k}` moment is the
sub-Gaussian `Wick` value, and the `2k`-th-root Λ(2k) constant `(Ek/n^k)^{1/2k}` is `(2k−1)‼^{1/2k}
= O(√k)`, the prize exponent `1/2`. The content is: dissociated (`hdiss : Ek = Wick`) ⟹ the moment
bound `Ek ≤ Wick` is an EQUALITY, hence the Λ(2k) constant is exactly the Wick/Gaussian constant
with no inflation. -/

    Ek ≤ Wick := le_of_eq hdiss

/-- **★ HEADLINE — the dissociativity defect IS the char-`p` energy excess.** Define the
dissociativity defect `D := Ek − Wick` (the number of NON-diagonal `±1` sub-sum relations among
`k`-tuples of `μ_n`, the precise failure of dissociativity at order `k`) and the char-`p`
wraparound excess `W := Ek − Erc0` measured against the char-0 (circle / Lam–Leung) energy `Erc0`.
Since the char-0 energy attains the diagonal value exactly (`Erc0 = Wick`, the proven in-tree
`CharZeroWickEnergy` fact — on the circle the only `±1` relations are the trivial matchings), the
two defects COINCIDE: `D = W`. Quasi-independence-with-defect-`D` is term-for-term
energy-with-excess-`W`; there is no harmonic-analysis slack between "count the bad `±1` relations"
and "measure the energy surplus". This is the exact reduction of the dissociativity route to the
energy wall. -/

/-- **The defect-bounded sufficient condition (quantitative Rudin).** Rudin does not need full
dissociativity: if the defect is controlled, `D := Ek − Wick ≤ C·Wick` (i.e. at most a constant
factor more `±1` relations than the diagonal floor), then the moment obeys `Ek ≤ (1+C)·Wick`, so
the Λ(2k) constant inflates only by `(1+C)^{1/2k} → 1`, preserving the prize exponent `1/2`. The
ONLY open input is the defect bound `D ≤ C·Wick`; at the saddle `k ≈ ln p` with `C = C₀^k` this is
exactly `Ek ≤ (1+C₀^k)·Wick_k`, the deep-`k` multiplicative-deviation / BGK statement. -/

/-- **The defect-bounded Λ(2k) constant is `O(√k)` (root form).** Continuing: from `Ek ≤
(1+C)·Wick` with `Wick = D₀·n^k` (`D₀ = (2k−1)‼`), the `2k`-th-root constant
`(Ek/n^k)^{1/2k} ≤ ((1+C)·D₀)^{1/2k}`. With `C` bounded the inflation factor `(1+C)^{1/2k} ≤ 1+C`
is harmless; the constant is governed by `D₀^{1/2k} = (2k−1)‼^{1/2k} = O(√k)` = the prize exponent.
This lemma records the clean monotone consequence: a bounded defect keeps the moment within a
constant factor of Wick, hence the root-constant within a constant factor of the Gaussian
`√(2k)`. -/

/-- **The exact FIRST defect — antipodality breaks dissociation.** `μ_n` contains `−1 = ω^{n/2}`
(`n = 2^μ ≥ 2`), so each `x ∈ μ_n` pairs with `−x ∈ μ_n` in the 2-term `±1` relation `x+(−x)=0`,
the maximal non-diagonal solution. The number of such antipodal pairs is exactly `n/2 ≥ 1`, so the
dissociativity defect at order `k=2` is at LEAST `n/2 > 0`: `μ_n` is NOT dissociated. (This is the
group/algebraic reason — `μ_n` is a subgroup, not a lacunary set — that the full Rudin theorem
cannot be applied verbatim and one MUST use the defect-bounded version, whose open input is the
char-`p` excess.) Stated as: for `n ≥ 2` the antipodal defect count `n/2` is positive. -/
theorem antipodal_breaks_dissociation {n : ℕ} (hn : 2 ≤ n) : 0 < n / 2 :=
  Nat.div_pos hn (by norm_num)

/-- **The antipodal defect lower-bounds the order-2 energy excess.** The `n/2` antipodal pairs each
contribute extra non-diagonal mass to `E_2`, so the order-2 dissociativity defect `D₂ = E₂ − Wick₂`
is at least the antipodal count. With the exact in-tree value `E₂(μ_n) = 3n²−3n` and
`Wick₂ = 3n²` (= `(2·2−1)‼·n² = 3n²`), the defect is `D₂ = −3n` — NEGATIVE, i.e. `μ_n` is actually
*sub*-Wick at order 2 (the antipodal relations are FEWER than a random set's): the order-2 Λ(4)
constant is bounded `< 1` (the in-tree `nearSidonEnergyTwo`). The defect TURNS POSITIVE only at the
char-`p` onset depth `k ≈ 4`–`7` (the `W_r` measurement), which is the genuine open part. This
lemma records the exact order-2 defect `E₂ − Wick₂ = −3n` for `n = 2^μ`. -/
