# Open-core SOS decomposition: the slack = two certified cushions − the wraparound residual (#444)

The prize reduces to the b≠0 sub-Gaussian energy `μ_{2r} ≤ Wick = (2r−1)‼·n^r`
(`μ_{2r} = (p·E_r(F_p) − n^{2r})/(p−1)`). This file records the **exact 3-term decomposition** of the open-core
slack that the SOS/positivity route found (verified by exact-integer probes, `n = 8,16`, `r ≤ 12`):
```
        (p−1)·(Wick − μ_{2r})  =  p·(Wick − E_r(ℂ))  +  (n^{2r} − Wick)  −  p·W_r,
```
where `E_r(ℂ)` is the char-0 energy and `W_r = E_r(F_p) − E_r(ℂ) ≥ 0` is the char-p wraparound excess. The first two
terms are **certified nonnegative**:
* `Wick − E_r(ℂ) ≥ 0` — the **char-0 Bessel deficit** (proven, `_CharZeroMGFBesselBound`: `E_r(ℂ) ≤ Wick`);
* `n^{2r} − Wick ≥ 0` — the **factorial gap** `(2r−1)‼ ≤ n^r` (elementary, for `r ≤ n`).

So the *entire* open content is the single wraparound residual `p·W_r`, cushioned by both nonneg terms:
```
        μ_{2r} ≤ Wick   ⟺   p·W_r  ≤  p·(Wick − E_r(ℂ)) + (n^{2r} − Wick).
```
This is **weaker** (more room) than the sharper `μ_{2r} ≤ E_r(ℂ)` form of `_OpenCoreCharPLighterReduction` (which
needs `p·W_r ≤ n^{2r} − E_r(ℂ)`); the extra room is exactly `(p−1)·(Wick − E_r(ℂ))`, the Bessel cushion. In
particular, **below the wraparound onset** (`W_r = 0`, exact-verified `r₀ = 6` at `n=16, β=4`, growing with β) the
open core holds outright, with both cushions to spare; combined with the proven `r=1` (Parseval) and `r=2`
(`W₂ = 0` at prize scale, the kurtosis order) cases, the open core is **unconditional for all `r` up to the onset**,
and the remaining work is bounding the wraparound `W_r` by the two cushions for `r` from the onset to `log p`.

**What this file proves (axiom-clean).** `slack_three_term_decomp` (the exact identity), `open_core_of_wraparound_le_cushions`
(`p·W_r ≤ cushions → μ ≤ Wick`), and `open_core_below_onset` (`W = 0` + both cushions nonneg → `μ ≤ Wick`). Issue #444.
