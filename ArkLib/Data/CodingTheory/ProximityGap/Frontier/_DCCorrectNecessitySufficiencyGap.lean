# The trivial-counting necessity is `~e^r ≈ q`-fold weaker than sufficiency (#444 / #407)

The DC-correct cluster gives two bounds on the DC-subtracted moment `S_r = q·E_r − |G|^{2r}`:

* **Sufficiency** (`_DCCorrectSupCapstone.worstPeriod_le_prizeFloor_dc`): the prize sup
floor FOLLOWS
  from the open hypothesis `S_r ≤ q·(2r·|G|)^r` (the char-`p`/BGK core).
* **Necessity** (`_DCCorrectMomentCeilingAtFloor.dcSubtractedMoment_le_prizeFloorCeiling`):
the prize
  sup floor FORCES `S_r ≤ (q−1)·(e·2r·|G|)^r = (q−1)·e^r·(2r·|G|)^r`.

These are NOT the same threshold. This file records the exact gap between them, so no one
mistakes the
trivial counting necessity for a step toward the prize:

> `necessityCeiling_ge_sufficiencyThreshold` : `(q−1)·e^r·B ≥ ((q−1)/q)·e^r · (q·B)` and in
particular,
> for `r ≥ 1` and `q ≥ 2`, the necessity ceiling `(q−1)·e^r·B` strictly EXCEEDS the sufficiency
> threshold `q·B` by a factor `≥ ((q−1)/q)·e^r` (which is `≈ e^r`, and at `r ≈ log q` is `≈ q`).

So the necessity bound is `~e^r`-fold LOOSER than the threshold the prize needs: it is automatically
satisfied with room to spare and carries NONE of the prize content. ALL the content is in the
sufficiency hypothesis `S_r ≤ q·B` (the genuinely-open `S_r/(q) ≤ Wick` = char-`p` energy wall).

> `necessity_does_not_imply_sufficiency` : the necessity ceiling `(q−1)·e^r·B` does NOT entail the
> sufficiency threshold `q·B` — exhibited by the gap factor being `> 1` for `r ≥ 1`, `q ≥
2`, `B > 0`.

**Honest status.** This is a constant-gap accounting lemma, NOT progress on CORE. It guards against
reading the elementary necessity counting bound as prize progress: the necessity is `~q×`
too weak, and
the open core is entirely the sufficiency side. No CORE / cancellation / completion /
anti-concentration
/ moment-saving / capacity claim. Prize CORE stays OPEN.

/-- **The necessity ceiling exceeds the sufficiency threshold by `≥ ((q−1)/q)·e^r`.** With base
`B = (2r·|G|)^r > 0`, the necessity ceiling `(q−1)·e^r·B` and the sufficiency threshold
`q·B` satisfy
`q·B ≤ (q−1)·e^r·B` once `q ≥ ((q−1)/q)·e^r·q`, i.e. once `e^r ≥ q/(q−1)`. For `r ≥ 1` (so
`e^r ≥ e > 2 ≥
q/(q−1)` whenever `q ≥ 2`), the necessity ceiling is strictly the LARGER bound — the necessity is
automatically met with `~e^r` room and is not the binding constraint. -/

/-- **Necessity does NOT imply sufficiency.** The necessity ceiling `(q−1)·e^r·B` strictly
exceeds the
sufficiency threshold `q·B` (gap factor `> 1`) for `q ≥ 2`, `r ≥ 1`, `B > 0` — so a witness
obeying the
(weak) necessity ceiling need not obey the (strong) sufficiency threshold. The prize content
is entirely
on the sufficiency side; the counting necessity is `~e^r ≈ q`-fold too loose to be the
binding bound. -/
