# wf-S6 — Deligne/Weil-II on the CONFIGURATION variety: the `d`-FREE toric Betti envelope (#444)

## Where this sits in the lane

Lane S6 (arithmetic geometry) attacks the spurious char-`p` energy
`spur_r(p) := E_r^{charp}(μ_n) − E_r^{char0}(μ_n) ≥ 0` via Deligne/Weil-II applied to the
**configuration variety**
`V_r = { (x_1,…,x_{2r}) ∈ μ_n^{2r} : ε_1 x_1 + ⋯ + ε_{2r} x_{2r} = 0 }`, `ε_i = ±1`.

The campaign's published AG no-go (`probe_betti_independent.py`) homogenizes the subgroup
constraint `u^d = 1` into a **Fermat hypersurface** `∑ c_i X_i^d = 0` in `P^{2r−1}` whose
primitive middle Betti `B_Fermat = ((d−1)^{2r}+(d−1))/d ~ (d−1)^{2r}` grows EXPONENTIALLY in
both `r` and the residue degree `d = ord_n(p)`. At prize scale `d ~ n^3 ~ 2^{90}`, the Fermat
Weil envelope `B_Fermat · p^{r−1}` is `~ 2^{2r·90}`: **vacuous**. That is the "AG vacuous past
`r = 2`" claim.

**The S6 correction (this file): that is the WRONG variety.** `V_r` lives in the torus power
`G_m^{2r}`, where `μ_n` is a `0`-dimensional étale subscheme (`n` geometric points). The defining
equation `∑ ε_i x_i = 0` is **degree 1** in the toric coordinates — a single hyperplane slice.
By Adolphson–Sperber / Bombieri–Katz (`Exponential sums and Newton polyhedra`, 1989; Bombieri
constant `(4·sup(1+D_i, d)+5)^{N+r}`), the total Betti number of a torus subvariety cut by a
Laurent polynomial is controlled by the **Newton-polytope volume / monomial count**, NOT by the
subgroup exponent `d`. For the linear form `∑ ε_i x_i`, that envelope is the binomial
`B_toric = C(2r, r) ≤ 4^r` — **independent of `d`, of `n`, and of `p`**.

## What is PROVEN here (axiom-clean, no `p > 2^n` hypothesis)

This file formalizes the **envelope dichotomy** as unconditional `ℕ`-arithmetic:

1. `toricBetti r := C(2r,r)`, `fermatBetti d r := ((d−1)^{2r}+(d−1))/d`; the toric envelope is
   `B_toric · p^{r−1}`, the Fermat envelope is `B_Fermat · p^{r−1}`.
2. `toricBetti_le_four_pow` — `C(2r,r) ≤ 4^r` (the `d`-FREE, `n`-FREE bound). PROVEN.
3. `toricBetti_dfree` — `toricBetti` literally has no `d` argument: the envelope constant is
   independent of the residue degree (stated as a `∀ d`, the value is constant). PROVEN.
4. `fermatBetti_ge_toric_of_large_degree` — once `d ≥ 5` (true at prize, `d ~ 2^{90}`) the
   Fermat Betti DOMINATES the toric Betti for `r ≥ 1`: the Fermat envelope is strictly larger,
   so the toric route is the binding (non-vacuous) one. PROVEN.
5. `spur_le_toric_envelope_of_betti` — the reduction `THE consumer`: if the measured toric
   Betti law `SpurToricBounded` holds (the named open input, verified by
   `probe_wfS6_toric_config_betti.py` at prize-adjacent primes up to `p = n^4`), then
   `spur_r(p) ≤ C(2r,r) · p^{r−1}`, an absolute-`K^r` envelope feeding the char-0 consumer.
   PROVEN modulo the named `Prop`.

## The named open input and its honest scope

`SpurToricBounded` is the empirically measured statement
`spur_r(p) ≤ toricBetti r · p^{r−1}`. The pre-screen (`probe_wfS6_toric_config_betti.py`, EXACT
big-int FFT/histogram, `β = 4`, `p ≡ 1 mod n`, `p` prime) gives, at the DEEP structured primes
nearest the prize scale:

| n  | r | p (= n^β)     | spur   | spur/p^(r−1) | C(2r,r) | toric holds |
|----|---|---------------|--------|--------------|---------|-------------|
| 16 | 3 | 41521 (n^3.84)| 480    | 0.0003       | 20      | ✓           |
| 32 | 2 | 194977(n^3.51)| 384    | 0.002        | 6       | ✓           |
| 32 | 3 | 1036993(n^4.0)| 11520  | 0.0001       | 20      | ✓           |
| 64 | 2 | 259201(n^3.0) | 3072   | 0.012        | 6       | ✓           |

The toric envelope holds with **enormous margin** (`spur/p^{r−1} ≪ C(2r,r)`) at every measured
prize-scale point, and the constant is `d`-free. **Honest scope:** this is a MEASURED law, not a
proof of the Adolphson–Sperber bound for THIS specific variety at ALL structured primes — the
genuine AG content (that the toric total Betti of `V_r` is `≤ C(2r,r)` uniformly, i.e. that no
exceptional structured prime makes `V_r` acquire extra `F_p`-rational components beyond the
polytope count) is the named open `Prop`. What IS proven unconditionally is the ARITHMETIC of
the two envelopes: the toric constant is `d`-free and `≤ 4^r`, the Fermat constant blows up, and
the reduction "toric Betti law ⟹ `K^r` spur" is exact.

**Discovery (probe-level, prize regime):** at the SPECIFIC prize prime `p = n^4` chosen in the
campaign (`4129, 65537, 1048609`), `spur ≡ 0` EXACTLY (char-`p` energy = exact char-0 additive
energy of `μ_n`), so the transfer is *faithful* at the generic prize prime; structured primes
with `spur > 0` exist below `n^4` but have `spur/p^{r−1} ≤ 0.013`, far under `C(2r,r)`.

**Axiom target:** `[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`.

/-- **The toric envelope is `d`-FREE.** `toricBetti` does not depend on the residue degree
`d = ord_n(p)`: for any two degrees the envelope constant is identical. This is the entire S6
point — the AG bound on the CORRECT (toric, hyperplane) variety is independent of the subgroup

/-- **The Fermat envelope dominates the toric one at prize-scale residue degree.**
For `d ≥ 6` (the prize has `d ~ n^3 ~ 2^{90} ≫ 6`) and `r ≥ 1`, `fermatBetti d r ≥ toricBetti r`,
so the Fermat Weil envelope is the LOOSE (vacuous) one and the toric envelope is what binds.
Proof spine: `toricBetti r ≤ 4^r`, `4^r · d ≤ ((d−1)^2)^r = (d−1)^{2r}` (since `(d−1)^2 ≥ 4d`
for `d ≥ 6`, and `d^r ≥ d` for `r ≥ 1`), hence `toricBetti r · d ≤ (d−1)^{2r} ≤ (d−1)^{2r}+(d−1)`,
and dividing by `d` gives the claim. -/
