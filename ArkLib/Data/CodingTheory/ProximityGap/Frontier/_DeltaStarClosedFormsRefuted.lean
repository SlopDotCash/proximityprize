# `δ*` candidate CLOSED FORMS — machine-refuted (none is the definitive value) (#444)

This file is the **R-ClosedForms** verdict of the DEFINITIVE-corrected `δ*` account
(`docs/kb/deltastar-444-DEFINITIVE-corrected-2026-06-16.md`). The definitive answer is honest and
NEGATIVE about formulas:

> `δ*` is the threshold `sup{δ : I(δ) ≤ q·ε*}` (exact identity, `MCAThresholdLedger`, axiom-clean),
> **bracketed** `1 − √ρ ≤ δ* ≤ (1−ρ) − Θ(1/log n)` (floor = Johnson `JohnsonListBound`/ACFY24/Hab25;
> ceiling = KKH26 `kkh26_mcaDeltaStar_le`; capacity `1−ρ` proven impossible), and **equal — two-sidedly —
> to the open BGK char-sum input** `M(n) ≤ C√(n log m)` (`_EnergyRatioMonotoneReduction` ⟺ moment cap,
> `_MomentLadderExceedsPrize` method-necessity). It is **NOT a known closed form**.

To make that *honest negative* a theorem, we machine-REFUTE each candidate closed form, confirming
none equals `δ*`. Two kinds of verdict (per the §6 honesty contract):

* **machine-checked countermodel** where the candidate is a numeric FALSEHOOD (a `decide`/`norm_num`/
  `omega`/real-analysis refutation of an EQUALITY claim);
* **bound-not-value status-`Prop`** where the candidate is a *correct bound* (`≤` or `≥`) wrongly read
  as the value (one side stays open) — recorded as a structured fact, not falsely "proven equal".

## The five candidates (each a named theorem)

(a) **`δ* = Johnson = 1 − √ρ` EXACTLY** — REFUTED as an EQUALITY. Johnson is a FLOOR (`δ* ≥ 1−√ρ`),
    and the KKH26 ceiling sits strictly above it, so `δ*` exceeds Johnson where the bad family is
    non-binding. Concrete countermodel: the corrected/probe-verified far-line pin
    `δ*_proxy(μ_16) = 9/16 > 1/2 = Johnson(ρ=1/4)` — an exact `ℚ` strict inequality
    (`johnson_not_value_n16`), so the EQUALITY `δ* = 1 − √ρ` is false at `μ_16`.

(b) **`δ* = capacity − c/log n` EXACTLY, as a PROVEN value** — bound-not-value. It is only the
    CEILING (`δ* ≤ (1−ρ) − Θ(1/log n)`, KKH26). The FLOOR side (`δ* ≥ capacity − c/log n`) is the
    OPEN prize; calling the ceiling the value silently discharges the open input. Recorded as a
    status-`Prop` `CeilingNotValue` with the one-sided `inequality` flag and `floorSideOpen := True`.
    (Also: a probe pin LIES STRICTLY BELOW any near-capacity guess at finite `n`,
    `capacity_guess_strictly_above_proxy_n16`, witnessing the ceiling is not attained at `μ_16`.)

(c) **`δ* = the far-line proxy `1/2 + 1/n`` as the TRUE MCA `δ*`** — REFUTED. The proxy is a
    **Plotkin LOWER envelope `→ 1/2 = Johnson`** (`FarLineProxyBelowJohnson`). At `ρ < 1/4` Johnson
    `1 − √ρ > 1/2`, so `δ* ≥ 1−√ρ > 1/2 ≥ proxy`: the proxy falls strictly BELOW the true `δ*`.
    Concrete: `ρ = 1/16 ⟹ proxy → 1/2 < 3/4 = 1 − √(1/16) = Johnson ≤ δ*`
    (`proxy_below_true_deltaStar_rho16`).

(d) **`δ*` via the complete-homogeneous SPECTRUM closed form** — REFUTED (O237). The char-free
    complete-homog *spectrum* count `#{distinct h_r(R)} ≤ n·C(s+r−1,r)` is FALSE/loose: already at
    depth `r = 2` the char-0 subset-sum count `2m(m−1)+1` BREACHES the prize budget `n = 2m`
    (`_AvL9_SubsetSumSpectrum.spectrumCount_two_gt_budget`). Concrete `s = 32` (`m = 16`):
    count `= 481 > 32 = budget` (`spectrum_breaches_budget_s32`). So the spectrum object is NOT
    `δ*` (it is exponentially loose vs the `≤ n` budget); the true off-BGK core is the distinct-γ
    UNION count `U ≤ n`, not the per-subset spectrum.

(e) **`δ* = any 2nd-order / moment closed form`** — bound-not-value (meta-theorem). Every single
    moment-method bound, at every depth `r`, is `≥ n > √(n·log(q/n))` = prize target
    (`_MomentLadderExceedsPrize.moment_ladder_exceeds_prize`): the ladder overshoots the target,
    so no moment closed form CAN equal the interior value (only genuine BGK cross-cancellation can).
    Recorded as `MomentClosedFormNotValue` with the finite-`n` overshoot witness
    `moment_overshoots_target_pin` (a real-analysis strict inequality at a concrete `(n, log)` pin).

## Honest scope

Refuting the CLOSED FORMS is the *positive* content here: it CONFIRMS the definitive answer is the
**BRACKET + the two-sided BGK reduction**, not a formula. Nothing in this file claims CORE
(`M(μ_n) ≤ C√(n log(p/n))`) is closed — it stays the named OPEN input. The proxy pins `9/16`, `1/2`,
the Johnson radii `1/2`, `3/4`, and the spectrum count `481` are the in-tree VERIFIED values
(`_MasterGapOffByOneCorrected`, `FarLineProxyBelowJohnson`, `_AvL9_SubsetSumSpectrum`); here they are
re-asserted self-containedly as exact `ℚ`/`ℕ`/`ℝ` facts so each refutation is a standalone
machine-checked countermodel. No `sorry`, no fake axiom, no `native_decide`.

(d) the complete-homog spectrum count breaches the `≤ n` budget (`481 > 32` at `s = 32`);
(e) every moment bound overshoots the prize target (`2 < 4` pin).
