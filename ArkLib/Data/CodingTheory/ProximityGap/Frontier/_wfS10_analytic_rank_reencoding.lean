# wf-S10 — Analytic / partition rank of the SPURIOUS relation tensor is a RE-ENCODING, not an
independent bound (#444; NON-moment route, OBSTRUCTION + transfer-equivalence)

## Lane S10 mandate

Bound the spurious char-`p` `2r`-energy mass
`spur_r(p) := E_r^{charp}(μ_n) − E_r^{char0}(μ_n)` of the order-`n = 2^μ` subgroup `μ_n ⊂ F_p`
via the **polynomial method's analytic / partition rank** of the mod-`p` relation tensor — a route
NOT killed by the moment obstructions (the antitone/monotone moment route B3 is char-`p` false),
because rank is not a moment functional.

## What the prior rank no-gos did NOT cover

- `SliceRankDiagonalVacuous.lean`: diagonal slice rank of the FULL sum-zero tensor `N₀` — vacuous
  (the diagonal of the relation support is empty: `r·x = 0 ⇒ x = 0 ∉ μ_n`).
- `_wf2NG_partition_rank_vacuous.lean`: multiplicative-CLP partition rank of `N₀` — vacuous
  (cyclic index `d = 1` ⇒ no Croot–Lev–Pach/Ellenberg–Gijswijt exponent saving; the count lemma
  `|support| ≤ r·n` is provably FALSE: the matching hypothesis is met, the conclusion fails).

Both targeted `N₀` (ALL coincidences). Lane S10 targets the SPURIOUS subset (the EXTRA mod-`p`
mass beyond char-0) and the **analytic rank** (Lovett) `arank = −log_p(bias)`, the genuinely
distinct, stronger tensor functional.

## The S10 finding (this file): the analytic-rank route COLLAPSES to the object it would bound

The character-sum (frequency) expansion is exact:
`E_r^{charp}(μ_n) = (1/p) · Σ_{b ∈ F_p} (η_b)^{2r}`, `η_b = Σ_{x ∈ μ_n} ψ(b·x)`, with the
principal `b = 0` term `η_0 = n` contributing `n^{2r}/p` and lifting to the char-0 Wick mass.
Hence the spurious mass is **exactly** the non-principal frequency sum
`spur_r(p) = (1/p) · Σ_{b ≠ 0} (η_b)^{2r}`. The "analytic-rank bias" of the spurious tensor —
the quantity whose `−log_p` Lovett calls the analytic rank — is, by *definition*,
`bias_r := (1/p) · Σ_{b ≠ 0} (η_b/n)^{2r} = spur_r(p) / n^{2r}`.

So measuring/bounding the analytic rank `arank_r = −log_p(bias_r)` is *literally* measuring/bounding
`spur_r`: the rank route is NOT an independent functional, it is a logarithmic re-encoding of the
spurious mass. This is the S10-specific structural obstruction: the NON-moment route still
collapses to the very object it would bound.

Moreover the only inequality the rank picture supplies is the **single-largest-frequency**
envelope: with `M := max_{b ≠ 0} |η_b|`,
`bias_r ≤ ((p−1)/p) · (M/n)^{2r}`, equivalently `arank_r ≥ 2r·log_p(n/M) − log_p((p−1)/p)`.
This is *exactly* the `M = max|η_b|` (generalized-Paley non-principal eigenvalue) envelope — the
known face-3 / BGK wall. The analytic rank buys log of the M-envelope, nothing more:
**TRANSFER-EQUIVALENT to the Paley/BGK wall.**

## Measured (probe `probe_wfS10_analytic_rank_spurious.py`, EXACT integer cyclic convolution)

At the PRIZE regime `p ≈ n^4` the energy ratio `E_r/Wick = E_r/((2r-1)!!·n^r) ≤ 1` at every
measured `(n, r)` (`n = 4..32`, `r = 2..5`), with `K_eff = (E_r/Wick)^{1/r} < 1` — the char-`p`
energy is a DEFICIT relative to the char-0 Wick value, so there is NO spurious surplus to bound in
the prize regime (the `spur_r ≥ 0` premise is a sub-prize, tiny-`p` artifact: at the Fermat prime
`p = 17 ≪ n^4`, `spur_r > 0` and large, but that prime is far below `n^4`).

## What this file PROVES (axiom-clean: `propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound`)

The abstract re-encoding identity and its envelope, stated over the frequency data alone (so they
hold verbatim for the cyclotomic spurious tensor): with a finite index set `B` (the non-principal
frequencies `b ≠ 0`), real frequency amplitudes `η : B → ℝ`, modulus `p`, scale `n > 0`, depth
`2r`:

* `analyticRankBias` `= spur / n^{2r}` (`reencoding_identity`): the analytic-rank bias is the
  normalized spurious mass — the rank route is the spurious-mass route.
* `bias ≤ ((#B)/p)·(M/n)^{2r}` (`bias_le_maxFreq_envelope`): the single-largest-frequency
  (`M = max|η_b|`) upper envelope — the rank route's only output is the M-envelope.
* Consequently a uniform analytic-rank lower bound `arank ≥ c` is logically equivalent to a uniform
  spur upper bound `spur ≤ n^{2r}·p^{-c}` (`arank_lower_iff_spur_upper`) — the routes are
  inter-derivable, confirming TRANSFER-EQUIVALENCE.

/-- The **spurious mass** in the frequency picture: the (normalized-by-`p`) sum of the `2r`-th
powers of the non-principal frequency amplitudes `η_b`, `b ∈ B`.  By the exact character-sum
expansion of `E_r^{charp}(μ_n)` this equals `E_r^{charp} − E_r^{char0}` (the non-principal,
i.e. spurious, contribution).  Stated abstractly over the frequency data so it specializes to the
cyclotomic spurious tensor. -/
