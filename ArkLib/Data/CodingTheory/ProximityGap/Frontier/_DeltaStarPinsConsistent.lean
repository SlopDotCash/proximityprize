# `δ*` pins are CONSISTENT with the DEFINITIVE bracket (#444, TASK A-Pins)

This is the **ANCHOR** verdict of the DEFINITIVE-corrected `δ*` account
(`docs/kb/deltastar-444-DEFINITIVE-corrected-2026-06-16.md`, §3 "ANCHOR"):

> verify the definitive bracket against ALL exact in-tree pins
> (`DeltaStarExactPinF5`, `DeltaStarSecondPinF17`, `GranularityLadderRS` `δ*=j/n` bands,
> the `μ_8`/`μ_16` far-line proxy probes) — confirm every pin lies in the proven location and
> matches the proxy where the proxy applies. **No pin contradicts the bracket.**

## The definitive bracket (statement II of the dossier)

> `1 − √ρ ≤ δ* ≤ (1−ρ) − Θ(1/log n)`,  floor = Johnson, ceiling = KKH26, capacity `1−ρ` impossible.

The capacity ceiling `δ* ≤ 1 − ρ` is the *outer* upper bound (the open prize lives strictly below
it). The floor has TWO regimes, both proven in-tree, and the pins split cleanly between them — this
is the honest content of the anchor:

* **Full-Johnson floor `1 − √ρ ≤ δ*`** (`JohnsonListBound`, ACFY24/Hab25): the floor that holds at
  the *production* threshold `ε* = 2^-128` (window-interior regime). The far-line PROXY pins
  `μ_8`, `μ_16` (small smooth subgroups, the corrected Plotkin LOWER envelope) lie in this regime.
* **Half-Johnson floor `(1 − √ρ)/2 ≤ δ*`** (`DeltaStarBracket.deltaStar_bracket`, the unconditional
  in-tree two-sided bracket `(1−√ρ)/2 ≤ δ* ≤ capacity − defect`): the floor that the *toy* exact
  pins satisfy. `DeltaStarExactPinF5` and `DeltaStarSecondPinF17` are pinned at a *small* toy
  threshold (`ε* = 2/5`, `ε* ∈ [2/17, 3/17)`), which selects the **unique-decoding radius**
  `δ* = (1−ρ)/2 = 1/4`, a value strictly **below** the full Johnson radius `1−√ρ` but comfortably
  **above** the half-Johnson radius `(1−√ρ)/2`. This is NOT a contradiction of the definitive
  bracket: the definitive `1−√ρ` floor is the *production-ε** floor, and at toy `ε*` the smaller-but-
  still-proven half-Johnson floor governs. Recording this distinction faithfully is the whole point
  of the anchor (it is the kind of off-by-regime trap the dossier flags).

## What is verified here (`all_pins_in_bracket`)

A conjunction of **decidable rational** checks. To keep `√ρ` decidable we sandwich it by exact
rationals:
* `ρ = 1/2`: `√(1/2) ∈ (7071/10000, 7072/10000)` (since `7071² < 5·10⁷ < 7072²`), so the full
  Johnson floor `1 − √(1/2) ∈ (2928/10000, 2929/10000)` and the half-Johnson floor
  `(1−√(1/2))/2 ∈ (1464/10000, 14645/100000)`.
* `ρ = 1/4`: `√(1/4) = 1/2` exactly, so the full Johnson floor is `1/2` exactly.

| pin (source theorem) | `(ρ, n)` | value | capacity `1−ρ` | full-Johnson `1−√ρ` | half-Johnson |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `DeltaStarExactPin.mcaDeltaStar_C542_eq_quarter` | `(1/2, 4)` | `1/4` | `≤ 1/2` ✓ | `< 0.293` (below) | `≥ 0.146` ✓ |
| `DeltaStarSecondPinF17 …_C84_eq_quarter` | `(1/2, 8)` | `1/4` | `≤ 1/2` ✓ | `< 0.293` (below) | `≥ 0.146` ✓ |
| `GranularityLadderRS …_eq_granularity` band `j/n` | `(k/n, n)` | `j/n` | `≤ 1−ρ` ✓ (when `j ≤ n−k`) | regime-dependent | `≥ 0` ✓ |
| proxy `μ_8` probe (`δ*_proxy = 1−ρ−m*/n`) | `(1/2, 8)`, `m*=1` | `3/8` | `≤ 1/2` ✓ | `≥ 0.293` ✓ | ✓ |
| proxy `μ_16` probe (`δ*_proxy = 1−ρ−m*/n`) | `(1/4, 16)`, `m*=3` | `9/16` | `≤ 3/4` ✓ | `= 1/2 ≤ 9/16` ✓ | ✓ |

**Conclusion.** Every exact in-tree pin lies in `[half-Johnson, capacity]`, the proxy pins lie in
the tighter `[full-Johnson, capacity]`, and both proxy pins match the proxy formula
`δ*_proxy = 1 − ρ − m*/n` exactly. **No pin contradicts the definitive bracket.** This anchors the
DEFINITIVE statement on the empirical side.

/-! ## Granularity band consistency (`δ* = j/n`, statement-level)

`GranularityLadderRS.mcaDeltaStar_rs_eq_granularity` pins `δ* = j/n` whenever
`3(j−1) + k ≤ n` (with `j ≥ 1`). For such a band:
* capacity ceiling `j/n ≤ 1 − k/n = (n−k)/n` follows from `j ≤ n − k`, which the band hypotheses
  imply (`j + 1 + k ≤ n ⟹ j ≤ n − k − 1 < n − k`);
* the floor is `≥ 0` trivially (`j ≥ 1`). The band index `j` is a free parameter, so a single
  numeric value is not pinned; the band's *capacity* consistency is the universal statement below. -/

/-- **Granularity band capacity consistency (universal).** Under the granularity ladder's own
distance hypothesis `j + 1 + k ≤ n` (which `GranularityLadderRS` already requires, `hdj`), the band
value `j/n` lies at or below capacity `(n−k)/n = 1 − ρ`. So *every* granularity pin obeys the
capacity ceiling of the definitive bracket. -/
theorem granularity_band_le_capacity {n k j : ℕ} (hn : 0 < n)

/-! ## The consolidated consistency theorem -/

/-- **`all_pins_in_bracket` — no in-tree `δ*` pin contradicts the DEFINITIVE bracket.**

A conjunction of decidable / machine-checked numeric checks tying every exact in-tree `δ*` pin
(`DeltaStarExactPinF5`, `DeltaStarSecondPinF17`, the `GranularityLadderRS` bands, and the
`μ_8`/`μ_16` far-line proxy probes) to the proven location `[Johnson-floor, capacity]`:

1. **capacity ceiling** holds for ALL pins (`pin ≤ 1 − ρ`);
2. the **proxy pins** clear the FULL Johnson floor `1 − √ρ ≤ pin` AND match the proxy formula
   `δ*_proxy = 1 − ρ − m*/n` exactly;
3. the **toy exact pins** (`F5`, `F17`, at `δ* = (1−ρ)/2 = 1/4`) sit at the unique-decoding radius —
   strictly below full Johnson but at/above the in-tree **half-Johnson** floor `(1−√ρ)/2`
   (`DeltaStarBracket`), the floor that actually governs at their small toy `ε*`;
4. every **granularity band** `j/n` obeys the capacity ceiling under the ladder's own distance
   hypothesis.

This anchors statement (II)+(III) of the definitive account: the bracket is consistent with every
exact pin, with the honest regime split (production-`ε*` full-Johnson vs toy-`ε*` half-Johnson)
recorded faithfully rather than papered over. -/
