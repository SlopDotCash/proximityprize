# The iterated dyadic tower descent (#407 / #444)

`_AntipodalDyadicSymmetric` formalized ONE octave of the antipodal descent: the antipodal polynomial
`P = ∏_{z∈Z}(X−z)(X+z)` equals `Q.comp (X^2)` for `Q = ∏(X − z²)`, so `P`'s spectrum lives on even
degrees with `P.coeff (2ℓ) = Q.coeff ℓ`. This file lands the **iterated** form — the full
antipodal-tower self-similarity behind #444 c.97's claim that *the worst-case 2-sparse list is
constant in `n` at a fixed dyadic ratio* `D/n = a/2^s`:

* **Composition associativity for `X`-powers** (`comp_X_pow_comp_X_pow`): iterating the one-octave
  descent `comp (X^2)` exactly `s` times collapses to a single `comp (X^{2^s})` — so an
  `s`-fold antipodally-towered set has polynomial `Q_s.comp (X^{2^s})` over a base of size `n/2^s`.
* **The general `comp (X^m)` coefficient descent** (`coeff_comp_X_pow_mul`,
  `coeff_comp_X_pow_eq_zero`): the spectrum of `Q.comp (X^m)` lives exactly on the `m`-divisible
  degrees, with `(Q.comp (X^m)).coeff (m·ℓ) = Q.coeff ℓ`. At `m = 2^s` this is the tower descent:
  the degree-`2^s ℓ` data of the size-`n` object IS the degree-`ℓ` data of the size-`n/2^s` base —
  prime-independent, constant in `n` at fixed dyadic ratio.

**Honest scope.** This is the prime-independent *algebraic* self-similarity engine (PROVEN, over any
commutative ring), the mechanism that makes the off-BGK list count prime-decoupled and `n`-uniform at
fixed dyadic ratio (#444 c.97). It is NOT a closure of the prize: the list **upper bound** — that the
elementary-symmetric constraints cut independently at each rung — is the open core, untouched here.

/-- **Composition associativity for `X`-powers.** Iterating `comp (X^a)` then `comp (X^b)` is a
single `comp (X^(a*b))`. Iterating the one-octave antipodal descent (`a = b = 2`) `s` times
therefore collapses to `comp (X^{2^s})` — the full tower in one step. -/
