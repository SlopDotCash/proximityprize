# The char-`p` Lam–Leung matching injection (abstract form) (#444, THREAD T2-lamleung-charp)

## The shape of the bound

The char-0 energy bound `E_r^{char0}(μ_n) ≤ (2r−1)‼·n^r` is proven (in-tree) by the **Lam–Leung
matching injection**: a solution of the energy equation `x₁+⋯+x_r = y₁+⋯+y_r` over `ℂ` (with all
`xᵢ, yⱼ ∈ μ_n`) is encoded by

  1. a **perfect matching** of the `2r` slot indices into antipodal-or-equal pairs (there are
     `(2r−1)‼` such matchings), together with
  2. an element of `[n]^r` recording one representative root per matched pair

— and this encoding is *injective*, giving `E_r^{char0} ≤ (2r−1)‼ · n^r`.

Over `F_p` the same encoding is **no longer injective on its own**: char-`p` "wraparound"
solutions (sums that vanish mod `p` without vanishing over `ℤ`) are NOT antipodally matched, so a
single `(matching, [n]^r)` pair can be hit by several genuinely distinct `F_p`-solutions. The
fix is to adjoin a **wraparound-tag** `t ∈ Tag` that disambiguates them, restoring injectivity into

  `Matching × [n]^r × Tag`.

If the tag alphabet has size `≤ 1 + τ` (one slot for the genuine char-0 image, `τ` extra slots for
the wraparound collisions it absorbs), the cardinality bound becomes

  `E_r(F_p) = |solutions| ≤ |Matching| · n^r · (1 + τ) = (2r−1)‼ · n^r · (1 + τ)`.

## What this file proves (axiom-clean) and what is the open residual

This file lands the **ABSTRACT injection lemma** unconditionally:

* `card_le_of_inject_into_triple` — given ANY injection `f : S ↪ A × B × T` (no structure assumed),
  `|S| ≤ |A| · |B| · |T|`. Pure `Fintype.card`/`Function.Injective` combinatorics.
* `card_le_of_tag_bounded` — if moreover `|T| ≤ 1 + τ`, then `|S| ≤ |A| · |B| · (1 + τ)`.
* `lamLeung_charP_card_le` — the Lam–Leung-shaped instantiation: with `A = Matching`,
  `|Matching| = oddFact r` (the `(2r−1)‼` matching count), `B = Fin n → Fin r`-style representative
  data of size `n^r` (passed as the abstract cardinality hypothesis), the energy solution set has
  `|solutions| ≤ oddFact r · n^r · (1 + τ)`.
* `lamLeung_charP_clean` — the corollary at `τ = 0` (no wraparound): the bound collapses to the
  exact char-0 Lam–Leung bound `|solutions| ≤ oddFact r · n^r`, recovering the proven char-0 face
  as the `τ = 0` slice.

**The named open residual is `τ` — the wraparound-tag multiplicity.** It is exactly the `W_r`
excess in disguise: `τ = 0` is the char-0 regime (proven), and a global bound `τ ≤ τ₀(r)` with
`τ₀(r*) = o(Wick)` at the saddle depth `r* ≈ log p` is the genuine open core of the prize
(equivalent to `p·W_r ≤ n^{2r} − E_r^{char0}`, the wraparound-collisions-bounded-by-their-mean
statement of `_OpenCoreCharPLighterReduction`). This file does NOT discharge `τ`; it isolates it as
the single combinatorial obligation the injection leaves open. The abstract lemma is genuinely
unconditional — the tag bound `|T| ≤ 1 + τ` is a HYPOTHESIS, not a hidden discharge of the prize.

Honesty: this is a `LANDED` brick — an axiom-clean abstract injection bound whose one named open
hypothesis (`τ`, the wraparound-tag count / `W_r` excess) IS the genuine open part. Issue #444.

/-! ## The Lam–Leung-shaped instantiation

We keep the matching alphabet `A` and the representative-data alphabet `B` abstract, pinned only by
their cardinalities (`|A| = oddFact r = (2r−1)‼`, `|B| = n^r`). This is the honest statement: the
*existence* of the injection with a tag alphabet of size `≤ 1 + τ` is the hypothesis; the
conclusion is the energy cardinality bound. The combinatorial content (that such `A, B, T, f` exist
over `F_p`) is summarized by the `τ` residual. -/

/-- **The char-`p` Lam–Leung cardinality bound.** Suppose the `F_p` energy solution set `S` (finite)
admits a Lam–Leung-style injection into `Matching × Repr × Tag`, where `Matching` is the antipodal-
matching alphabet with `|Matching| = oddFact r` (the `(2r−1)‼` char-0 matchings), `Repr` is the
representative-root data with `|Repr| = n^r`, and `Tag` is the wraparound-tag alphabet with
`|Tag| ≤ 1 + τ`. Then

  `|S| ≤ (2r−1)‼ · n^r · (1 + τ)`.

The factor `(1 + τ)` is the *only* gap between this and the proven char-0 bound; `τ` (the
wraparound-tag multiplicity, equal to the `W_r` excess) is the named open residual. -/

/-- **The `τ = 0` collapse (char-0 face recovered).** When there is no wraparound (`τ = 0`, the
char-0 regime / below the `W_r` onset), the tag alphabet is trivial (`|Tag| ≤ 1`) and the bound
collapses to the exact proven Lam–Leung char-0 bound `|S| ≤ (2r−1)‼ · n^r`. This shows the abstract
lemma genuinely *contains* the char-0 result as its `τ = 0` slice (not a vacuous discharge). -/

/-- **Monotonicity in the tag residual.** A smaller wraparound-tag bound gives a smaller energy
bound: the char-`p` energy ceiling is monotone in `τ`. This records that *driving `τ` down toward 0*
(the open program) monotonically tightens the bound toward the char-0 ideal `(2r−1)‼·n^r`. -/

/-- **Naming the residual as the `W_r` excess.** This `def` makes the open obligation a first-class
named `Prop`: *there is a global wraparound-tag bound `τ ≤ τ₀(r)` valid at the saddle depth*. The
prize is exactly the assertion `WraparoundTagBounded` with `τ₀(r*) ` small enough that
`oddFact r* · n^r* · (1 + τ₀(r*)) ≤ (2r*−1)‼ · n^{r*} · (1 + o(1))`, i.e. the wraparound collisions
do not exceed their heuristic mean (`p·W_r ≤ n^{2r} − E_r^{char0}` of
`_OpenCoreCharPLighterReduction`). Stating it does NOT prove it — it is the named open residual. -/
