# Assault V2 — Lever `CONJ41_C_height`: the Open-Set-Rank degeneracy escape + realizability height
# (Chai–Fan 2026/858 §7; dossier §6.4)

## What this file banks

The prize-favorable reading of Conjecture 41 was: "there is a polynomial `p₀` such that for every
prime `p > p₀` the `(w+1)`-clique normal matrix `A = [N | γN]` has full rank `D + c`, hence
`M_true < k` (no above-Johnson list element)". Two facts already proven in-tree
(`Round20CliqueKernel`, `Round23CliqueDegeneracy`) destroy that reading:

* **(K) The clique pencil is in the kernel over EVERY field.** `clique_kernel_mem` exhibits, for an
  *arbitrary* weight `b : F → F` and twist `γ`, an explicit kernel vector of `A`. So `A` is
  rank-deficient unconditionally — there is **no special prime `p₀`** restoring full rank.
* **(R) The deficiency is `≥ w+1` over every field, with the SAME floor `W.card`.**
  `cliqueKernelSpace_finrank_ge`.

This file welds those into **one** axiom-clean headline that permanently banks the
"identically-zero rank deficiency, not a mod-p coincidence" verdict (`conj41_no_good_prime`), and
then **REFUTES the degeneracy escape clause**.

## The degeneracy escape clause, and why it is FALSE

The only surviving prize-favorable reading was: *maybe every persistent rank-deficient syndrome is
"degenerate" — a false positive supported on the `(w+1)`-set with **not all** error values
nonzero (some `b(α) = 0`).* If true, a genuine full-weight error could never sit in the kernel, and
the above-Johnson list element would be a phantom.

This is **false** for the clique, over every field. Take `b = (fun _ => 1)` — a full-weight
(all-coordinates-nonzero) weight vector. By `clique_kernel_mem` its pencil `s₂(b)` lies in the
kernel; by `pairing_kernel_pencil_ne_zero_iff` every coordinate weight is recoverable and nonzero,
so the kernel member is a **genuine weight-`(w+1)` error** on `W`. Hence *not* every kernel member
is degenerate — there is an all-nonzero one over any field (`clique_full_weight_kernel_member`,
`degeneracy_escape_clause_false`).

## Consequence for the prize

After both the no-`p₀` weld and the degeneracy refutation, Conjecture 41 cannot supply the prize
upper bound through "rank over `ℚ`" + "good prime existence". The ONLY remaining lever is **(ii)**:
bound the log-height of the all-nonzero-realizability resultant by `poly(n)`. The PTE witness
`E1 = {0,1,5,8,12,21}` makes the height exponential explicit (computed in the docstring below): the
clique relation coefficients are the Lagrange weights `c(α) = 1/N'(α)`, with denominators whose lcm
is `2^6·3^3·5·7·11·13 = 8 648 640` already at `w+1 = 6` nodes — the **E2W4 residual replicated at
codim `c ≥ 3`, exponential, not discharged**. This file does NOT close that height question; it
banks the structural verdict and refutes the degeneracy escape, which is the bankable content.

## Exact PTE numerics (probe, not proof — `python3` exact rationals)

`W = {0,1,5,8,12,21}` (`w+1 = 6` nodes). The clique row dependency is the divided-difference
power-sum identity: with `c(α) = 1/N'(α)`, `N(X) = ∏_{β∈W}(X−β)`,

```
Σ_{α∈W} c(α)·α^k = 0  for k = 0,1,2,3,4 (= 0..w−1),   = 1 for k = w = 5.
```

(verified exactly: weights `[-1/10080, 1/6160, -1/6720, 1/8736, -1/33264, 1/786240]`, all NONZERO ⇒
the canonical clique relation is full-weight ⇒ degeneracy escape is false; lcm of denominators
`= 8 648 640 = 2^6·3^3·5·7·11·13`, the integer-height witness). The relation holds over every field
of characteristic not dividing a pairwise difference `{1,3,4,5,7,8,9,11,12,13,16,20,21}` (primes
`2,3,5,7,11,13`) — i.e. over every prime where `W` stays `6` distinct residues.

NON-MOMENT structural (rides the in-tree clique duality; no Wick/energy/char-sum). Honest scope:
this banks the "no `p₀`" + "degeneracy escape false" verdicts; the realizability **height** bound
remains the OPEN §6.4 residual (REDUCES_TO the E2W4 exponential-height wall).

*every* twist `γ`, the `(w+1)`-clique kernel space `cliqueKernelSpace D W γ` has dimension at least
`W.card = w+1`. There is therefore **no special prime `p₀`** at which the clique configuration
becomes full-rank: the rank deficiency is structural (identically zero), not an arithmetic
mod-`p` coincidence. This permanently kills the "poly `p₀` ⟹ prize" reading of Conjecture 41. -/

weight `b = 1`. Its pencil `s₂(1)` lies in the kernel (`clique_full_weight_kernel_member`), and at
*every* vertex `α ∈ W` the recoverable error value is nonzero (`fullWeight_pencil_pairing_ne_zero`).
So there is an all-nonzero (full-weight `w+1`) kernel member over every field — the degeneracy
escape clause does not hold, and the prize cannot be banked through it. -/

/-! ## 3. The PTE realizability-height witness `E1 = {0,1,5,8,12,21}` (the remaining open lever).

The two facts above retire readings (rank-over-ℚ + good prime) and (degeneracy escape). The ONLY
surviving lever is the **all-nonzero realizability height** (dossier §6.4(ii)): bound
`log-height(Res)` of the resultant whose vanishing realizes the full-weight clique error as a
genuine RS codeword by `poly(n)`. The clique relation coefficients `c(α) = 1/N'(α)` make this
exponential already at `w+1 = 6`: their common denominator is

  `lcm |N'(α)| = 8 648 640 = 2^6 · 3^3 · 5 · 7 · 11 · 13`.

We record the witness node set and its size as a Lean datum so the height target is anchored
in-tree. (The exponential-height claim itself is the OPEN residual; we do NOT assert a bound.) -/

/-- The PTE realizability-height witness node set `E1 = {0,1,5,8,12,21}` over `ℚ` — `w+1 = 6`
distinct nodes. The clique relation among its locators has full-weight (all-nonzero) integer-Lagrange
coefficients with denominator `8 648 640`; bounding the realizability resultant height by `poly(n)`
is the remaining open §6.4(ii) lever (REDUCES to the E2W4 exponential-height wall). -/
