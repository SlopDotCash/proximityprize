# Threshold-Halving Window Inequality — #334 frontier (ePrint 2026/858 route)

**Target.** The pure real-arithmetic kernel underneath Chai–Fan,
*FRI Soundness Above the Johnson Bound via Threshold Halving* (ePrint 2026/858).
For a rate `ρ ∈ (0, 1)`, write the **Johnson radius** as `δ_J(ρ) = 1 − √ρ`.  The paper's
above-Johnson soundness window is the proximity band

  `δ ∈ (δ_J(ρ), 1 − ρ)`.

The mechanism: their correlated-agreement analysis is run not at `δ` but at the **halved**
radius `δ/2`, and the key fact making it unconditional is that the halved radius stays strictly
**below** the Johnson radius across the *entire* window:

  `δ < 1 − ρ  ⟹  δ/2 < 1 − √ρ = δ_J(ρ)`.

Below `δ_J` the BCIKS (ePrint 2025/2055) correlated-agreement / unique-decoding analysis is
**unconditional**, so threshold-halving converts an above-Johnson statement (the open wall) into a
below-Johnson one (proven), at the cost of ≈2× queries (`ε_FRI ≤ nR/|F| + (1 − δ/2)^q`).

This file formalizes the **window inequality** (`halved_radius_below_johnson`) as clean real
arithmetic, plus the **distance-lock corollary** (`distance_lock_below_johnson`) which states
that at `δ/2` a named BCIKS below-Johnson regime predicate fires.  The BCIKS substrate is **not**
in this tree, so its applicability is carried as an explicit named `Prop` hypothesis
`BelowJohnsonRegime`, never a hidden `sorry`.

## The arithmetic heart

Let `x = √ρ ∈ (0, 1)`, so `ρ = x²`.  The gap between the Johnson radius and the midpoint of
`[0, 1 − ρ]` is

  `δ_J(ρ) − (1 − ρ)/2 = (1 − √ρ) − (1 − ρ)/2 = (1 − 2√ρ + ρ)/2 = (1 − √ρ)²/2 ≥ 0`.

Hence `(1 − ρ)/2 ≤ 1 − √ρ`.  Combined with `δ < 1 − ρ ⟹ δ/2 < (1 − ρ)/2`, this gives
`δ/2 < 1 − √ρ`.  Note the conclusion is strict because the `δ < 1 − ρ` step is strict; the
`(1 − ρ)/2 ≤ 1 − √ρ` step is only `≤` (equality at `ρ = 1`, excluded anyway by `ρ < 1`).

## Honesty / scope

This proves the **lossy (2×-query) above-Johnson window arithmetic** of the *unconditional*
threshold-halving route.  It is NOT the grand zero-loss `δ*` (the open BGK wall): the prize wants
soundness at radius `δ` *itself* with no query blow-up, which this route explicitly does not give.
Everything here is `sorry`/`axiom`-free; the only BCIKS dependence is a named hypothesis.

/-! ## Distance-lock corollary (BCIKS below-Johnson regime, named hypothesis)

The BCIKS (ePrint 2025/2055) substrate that makes the below-Johnson correlated-agreement analysis
unconditional is **not** in this tree.  We therefore carry its applicability as an explicit named
predicate.  `BelowJohnsonRegime ρ r` says: at relative rate `ρ`, every analysis radius `r` strictly
below the Johnson radius `1 − √ρ` enjoys the unconditional BCIKS regime.  The corollary below shows
that the threshold-halved radius `δ/2` *fires* this predicate for every window radius `δ` — i.e.
the lock engages — WITHOUT asserting the predicate itself (that is the imported BCIKS fact). -/

/-- Named BCIKS below-Johnson predicate (NOT proven here — it is the imported ePrint 2025/2055
unconditional correlated-agreement regime).  `BelowJohnsonRegime ρ r` is meant to hold exactly when
`r` is a strictly-below-Johnson analysis radius at rate `ρ`; we model that triggering condition as
`r < johnsonRadius ρ`. -/
def BelowJohnsonRegime (ρ r : ℝ) : Prop := r < johnsonRadius ρ

/-- **Distance-lock corollary.**  Given the BCIKS below-Johnson regime predicate as a *hypothesis*
of the form `∀ r, r < johnsonRadius ρ → BelowJohnsonRegime ρ r` (vacuously true under the modelling
`def` above, but stated abstractly so any real BCIKS substrate plugs in verbatim), the
threshold-halved radius `δ/2` of any window radius `δ` lies in that regime.

This is the honest "distance lock": the lossy 2×-query route's analysis radius `δ/2` is locked
below Johnson, so the unconditional BCIKS unique-decoding/correlated-agreement machinery applies. -/
theorem distance_lock_below_johnson {ρ δ : ℝ} (hρ0 : 0 ≤ ρ) (hρ1 : ρ ≤ 1)
    (hδ : δ < windowTop ρ)
    (hBCIKS : ∀ r : ℝ, r < johnsonRadius ρ → BelowJohnsonRegime ρ r) :
    BelowJohnsonRegime ρ (δ / 2) :=
  hBCIKS (δ / 2) (halved_radius_below_johnson hρ0 hρ1 hδ)

/-- The modelling predicate is discharged by the window inequality itself: under the `def`
`BelowJohnsonRegime ρ r := r < johnsonRadius ρ`, the hypothesis of `distance_lock_below_johnson`
holds unconditionally, so the lock is realized as a clean (sorry-free) consequence of the
arithmetic.  (A real BCIKS substrate would replace this trivial discharge with the imported
unconditional regime fact.) -/
