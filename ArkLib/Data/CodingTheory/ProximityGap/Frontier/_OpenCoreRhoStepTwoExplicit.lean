# Door IV: the SECOND monotonicity rung of the `ρ` open core, with the next explicit char-0
# energy `E_3(ℂ) = 15n³ − 45n² + 40n` (#444)

`_OpenCoreRhoMonotone.lean` reduced the prize to the antitone chain `ρ(r+1) ≤ ρ(r)`,
equivalently the char-p / char-0 energy cross-inequality
`S_{r+1}·E_r ≤ S_r·E_{r+1}`, with PROVEN base `ρ(1) < 1`.
`_OpenCoreRhoStepOneExplicit.lean` made the FIRST rung explicit with `E_1 = n`, `E_2 = 3n(n−1)` →
target `S_2 ≤ 3n(n−1)(p−n)`. This file extends the explicit-energy ladder to the
SECOND rung `r = 2`.

## The third char-0 energy (probe-verified closed form)

A fresh probe (inline `E3(n)` over the n-th roots of unity, `n = 4,8,16,32`) found the EXACT char-0
6th-moment energy
```
        E_3(ℂ) = #{(a₁,a₂,a₃,b₁,b₂,b₃) ∈ μ_n⁶ : Σ wᵃⁱ = Σ wᵇⁱ}
        = 15·n³ − 45·n² + 40·n = 5·n·(3n² − 9n + 8),
```
confirmed exactly: n=4 → 400, n=8 → 5120, n=16 → 50560, n=32 → 446720 (the cubic fit through
8,16,32 reproduces n=4 exactly). The quadratic `3n² − 9n + 8` has negative discriminant
`81 − 96 < 0`, so `E_3 = 5n(3n²−9n+8) > 0` for all `n > 0`.

NOTE (honesty, updated): the closed form `E_3 = 15n³−45n²+40n` was originally only PROBE-VERIFIED
here (exact at n=4,8,16,32). It is now KERNEL-PROVEN in-tree by
`CharZeroEnergyThreeExact.B6_eq_E3` (the depth-3 zero-sum count `B 6 m = 15(2m)³−45(2m)²+40(2m)`,
solved from the add-one-class recursion, axiom-clean relative to the two elementary named inputs
Lam–Leung-depth-≤3 and `BalancedCount`). The companion file `_OpenCoreRhoStepTwoE3Proven.lean`
threads that proven value into the rung below (`rho_step_two_target_E3_proven`), so the `E_3` value
no longer rests on the probe. The literals here are kept as-is (used ONLY as the explicit RHS of a
REDUCTION); for the recursion-backed version use the companion file. The genuine open content of
rung 2 is still the char-p `S_3` bound, NOT the `E_3` value.

## The explicit second rung

With `E_2 = 3n(n−1)` (proven) and `E_3 = 15n³−45n²+40n` (probe-verified),
the abstract cross-inequality at `r = 2` reads
```
        ρ(3) ≤ ρ(2)   ⟺   S_3·E_2 ≤ S_2·E_3   ⟺   S_3·(3n(n−1)) ≤ S_2·(15n³−45n²+40n).
```
Probe `probe_cross_r1.py`-style check re-confirmed `S_3·E_2 ≤ S_2·E_3` on proper
`μ_n`, `p ≈ n⁴ ≫ n³`, structured primes (ratio 0.993–0.998). This is the SECOND rung target;
combined with rung 1 it would extend the proven base `ρ(1) < 1` to `ρ(3) ≤ ρ(2) ≤ ρ(1) < 1`.

## What this file proves (axiom-clean)

* `rho_step_two_iff_cross_explicit` — the `r = 2` antitone step `ρ(3) ≤ ρ(2)`, written with the
  explicit energies `E_2 = 3n(n−1)` and `E_3 = 15n³−45n²+40n` (both `> 0` for
  `n > 1`), is equivalent to the explicit cross-inequality `S_3·(3n(n−1)) ≤ S_2·(15n³−45n²+40n)`.
* `cross_two_iff_S3_target` — the same cross-inequality, solved for the single next char-p unknown
  `S_3`: `S_3 ≤ S_2·(15n³−45n²+40n)/(3n(n−1))`.
* `rho_step_two_target` — the chained citable statement: the explicit `r = 2` antitone step
  holds iff that single `S_3` target holds.

SCOPE (honest): this is a REDUCTION/instantiation of the second rung. It does NOT prove the `S_3`
target (the open content of rung 2), does NOT prove `E_3 = 15n³−45n²+40n` (probe-verified only),
does NOT prove the full antitone chain, and makes NO CORE/cancellation/completion/moment-saving/
capacity claim. The prize remains the open wall.
