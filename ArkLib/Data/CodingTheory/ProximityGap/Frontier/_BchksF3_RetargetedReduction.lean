# BCHKS F3 — RE-TARGETED reduction onto the CORRECT object (Sumset-Extremality) (#444)

**Spec (F3).** The in-tree "complete reduction" `_CoreReductionComplete.prize_reduces_to_BCHKS`
is **vacuous**: its single open hypothesis is `hBCHKS : |Σ_r(μ_s)| ≤ budget` (the distinct
`r`-fold subset-sum count is within the prize budget `≈ n`). That hypothesis is **UNSATISFIABLE** —
exact computation (`scripts/probes/probe_subsetsum_grows_refutes_bchks.py`) shows `|Σ_r(μ_s)|`
GROWS monotonically in `r` and is ALWAYS `≫ budget`:

```
n=s=8  budget~8:  |Σ_r| = 33, 96, 225, 456, 833, 1408, 2241   (r=2..8) — never ≤ 8.
n=s=16 budget~16: |Σ_r| = 129, 704, 2945, 10128, 29953, 78592, 185617 — never ≤ 16.
```

So `∃ m, BCHKSBudget …` is false on this `Σ`, and `prize_reduces_to_BCHKS` proves the window
interior **vacuously on a false hypothesis** — it pins nothing about `δ*`. (This matches
`_BchksF1`/B33 `objectIdentity_false`: the bad cascade `D` *decreases* while `|Σ_r|` *increases* —
they are different objects, and the dedup `D ≤ |Σ_r|` has enormous, growing slack.)

The mis-statement put the **sumset on the wrong side** of the inequality. `|Σ_r| = |H^{(+r)}|` is
the SUMSET SIZE; in the correct floor (ABF26 §4) the sumset is the *budget multiplier*, NOT the
bad-scalar count.

## The CORRECT floor — Sumset-Extremality (ABF26 §4)

`|F|` is taken **LARGE** (not fixed at `n·2^128`). The soundness error is `(#bad)/|F|`, and
**`δ*` is the radius where `#bad` goes from `poly(n)` to super-poly** (crosses `ε*·|F|`). The open
FLOOR is

> **Sumset-Extremality.** For every affine line `(f, g)` and every `δ` below the threshold,
> `#{λ : Δ(f + λg, C) ≤ δ} ≤ poly(n) · |H^{(+r)}|`,

i.e. the bad-scalar count `#bad = D*(m)` (the distinct-`γ` count) is bounded by `poly(n)` times the
`r`-fold sumset size `|H^{(+r)}| = |Σ_r(μ_s)|`. The dedup `#bad = D ≤ |H^{(+r)}|` is **TRUE** (the
in-tree `_CoreA3.BCHKS_imp_weakestSuff` dedup domination `hdom : D ≤ Σ`); the FLOOR additionally
needs `#bad ≤ poly · (sumset)` together with `poly · (sumset) ≤ ε*·|F|` at the binding fold (the
soundness budget for `|F|` large), which is what pins `δ*` from below.

## What this file proves (axiom-clean)

1. `subsetSumBudget_unsat` — the **refutation** of the old form at the witnessed instances
   (`n=s=16`: `|Σ_4| = 10128 > 16 = budget`), with the abstract corollary that ANY `Σ` agreeing
   with these computed values makes the old `∃ m ≤ M, |Σ_{r m}| ≤ budget` form unsatisfiable below
   the witnessed fold — so `prize_reduces_to_BCHKS` is vacuous as documented.

2. `SumsetExtremality` — the **CORRECT named floor predicate** (the single open input): at the
   binding fold, `#bad ≤ poly · |H^{(+r)}|` AND `poly · |H^{(+r)}| ≤ ε*·|F|`. Equivalently the
   bad-scalar count is within the soundness budget `ε*·|F|` *because* it is dominated by the sumset
   times a polynomial factor (the sumset on the RIGHT side, as a budget multiplier).

3. `badCount_within_soundness_of_sumsetExtremality` — the **core re-targeted lemma**: from
   `SumsetExtremality` the bad-scalar count `#bad` is within the soundness budget `ε*·|F|`. This is
   the *meaningful* (non-vacuous) version of the budget crossing — the sumset is a multiplier, not
   the count.

4. `prize_reduces_to_SumsetExtremality` — the **RE-TARGETED master reduction**: the window-interior
   conclusion `1 − √ρ < δ* < 1 − ρ` follows from exactly ONE open hypothesis, `SumsetExtremality`
   (the correct floor), with everything else discharged exactly as in `prize_reduces_to_BCHKS`
   (master gap identity E1, proven edge `m* ≥ 3`, prize-regime Johnson surrogate, monotone binder
   reduction). The chain is identical *except* the open input is the correct sumset-extremality
   floor instead of the false `|Σ_r| ≤ budget`.

5. `oldForm_vacuous_newForm_satisfiable` — a witness separating the two: a concrete model where the
   OLD `|Σ_r| ≤ budget` is FALSE at the binding fold (the count grows) yet the NEW
   `SumsetExtremality` HOLDS (count dominated by `poly·sumset ≤ ε*·|F|`), so the re-targeted
   reduction is genuinely non-vacuous where the old one was vacuous.

## Honesty (the contract)

This is an honest **complete REDUCTION onto the correct object**, not a closure. The window-interior
conclusion is *proved* modulo the single explicit `Prop` `SumsetExtremality` (ABF26 §4, the open
floor). That Prop is NOT discharged anywhere — it is the open prize. The DEDUP half
(`#bad = D ≤ |H^{(+r)}|`) is the in-tree `_CoreA3` `hdom`; the FLOOR (`#bad ≤ poly·sumset ≤ ε*|F|`)
is the genuinely open Sumset-Extremality. Everything else (the master gap algebra, `m* ≥ 3`, the
monotone reduction, the prize-regime Johnson surrogate) is proven, reproved inline so the file is
self-contained and lands with a real `lake build`. The axiom audit must show only a subset of
`{propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound}` (no `sorryAx`, no `native_decide`, no fabricated axiom).

/-! ## 1. The OLD form is unsatisfiable — refutation of `|Σ_r| ≤ budget` -/

/-- The OLD (mis-stated) BCHKS budget predicate: the distinct `r`-fold subset-sum count
`Sigma s r = |Σ_r(μ_s)|` is within budget `B`. This is the hypothesis of the vacuous
`_CoreReductionComplete.prize_reduces_to_BCHKS`. -/

  Sigma s r ≤ B

/-- **Refutation of the OLD form at a witnessed instance.** The exact computation
(`probe_subsetsum_grows_refutes_bchks.py`) gives `|Σ_4(μ_16)| = 10128`, far above the budget
`16`. So for ANY `Sigma` matching this computed value, `SubsetSumBudget Sigma 16 4 16` is FALSE —
the old hypothesis fails at the witnessed fold. -/

/-- **The OLD form is unsatisfiable below the witnessed fold (the source of vacuity).** Given the

all `> 16`), no fold `r ∈ {2,3,4,5}` satisfies the budget. Hence the existential
`∃ r ∈ {2,3,4,5}, SubsetSumBudget Sigma 16 r 16` — the kind of hypothesis the old reduction needs
to discharge `m* ≤ M` — is FALSE. This is precisely why `prize_reduces_to_BCHKS` is vacuous: its
sole open hypothesis can never hold at the binding scale. -/

/-! ## 2. The CORRECT named floor — Sumset-Extremality (the single open input) -/

/-- **Sumset-Extremality (ABF26 §4) — THE correct open floor.**

`SumsetExtremality bad sumset poly soundness` packages the two pieces of the correct floor at the
binding fold:

* the **dedup-extremality** `bad ≤ poly · sumset`: the bad-scalar count `#bad = D*(m)` (the
  distinct-`γ` count) is bounded by `poly(n)` times the `r`-fold sumset size
  `sumset = |H^{(+r)}| = |Σ_r(μ_s)|` (the sumset is a MULTIPLIER on the RIGHT, not the count);
* the **soundness budget** `poly · sumset ≤ soundness`: that `poly(n)`-times-sumset is itself within
  the soundness budget `soundness = ε*·|F|` for `|F|` large.

Together they pin `#bad ≤ soundness`, i.e. the bad set is within the soundness error `ε*·|F|`,
which is the budget crossing that pins `δ*` from below. This is the ABF26 §4 floor — char-free
additive combinatorics (a Cauchy–Davenport / Plünnecke-flavoured extremality), NOT the false
`sumset ≤ budget`. It is the only hypothesis the re-targeted reduction does not discharge. -/
def SumsetExtremality (bad sumset poly soundness : ℕ) : Prop :=
  bad ≤ poly * sumset ∧ poly * sumset ≤ soundness

/-- **The core re-targeted lemma — `#bad` within soundness from Sumset-Extremality.**
The bad-scalar count is within the soundness budget `ε*·|F|` because it is dominated by the sumset
times a polynomial factor (transitivity through the multiplier). This is the *meaningful*
budget-crossing — the sumset on the RIGHT — replacing the false `sumset ≤ budget`. -/

/-! ## 6. THE RE-TARGETED COMPLETE REDUCTION THEOREM -/

/-- **`prize_reduces_to_SumsetExtremality` — THE re-targeted complete reduction (F3, #444).**

The window-interior conclusion `1 − √ρ < δ* < 1 − ρ` follows from exactly **ONE** open hypothesis —
the **correct** floor `SumsetExtremality (bad-count) (sumset) poly soundness` at the binding fold
`M = k − 1`. Everything else is discharged exactly as in `prize_reduces_to_BCHKS`:

### Discharged (proved) inputs
* `hE1` — the master gap identity `δ* = 1 − ρ − (m*−1)/n` (B01/E1).
* `hk, hρpos, hρ4` — the prize regime `k = ρ·n`, `0 < ρ ≤ 1/4`.
* `hmono` — cascade monotonicity (B48). Supplied as the monotonicity datum.
* `hedge_val` — the proven over-det edge value `D n 2 = Dedge m > 4m = soundness` (CoreA1), giving
  the **proved** lower bound `m* ≥ 3` (hence `2 ≤ m*`, the capacity side, with NO hypothesis).
* `hbad`, `hmstar_real`, `hkNat`, `hk_ge` — bridge data (bad-count at depth `M = kNat − 1`,
  the ℝ binding depth, the fold reindex).

### The ONE open input — the CORRECT object
* `SumsetExtremality (D n (kNat − 1)) sumset poly (soundness n)` — **ABF26 §4 Sumset-Extremality**
  at the binding fold: the bad-scalar count `#bad = D*(M)` is bounded by `poly(n) · |H^{(+r)}|` AND
  that product is within the soundness budget `ε*·|F|`. The sumset `|H^{(+r)}|` appears as a
  *multiplier on the right* (NOT `sumset ≤ budget`, which is false). This is the open floor, NOT
  discharged here.

### Conclusion
`1 − √ρ < δ* < 1 − ρ`: the list-decoding threshold is strictly inside the Johnson–capacity window.

This re-targets the bridge program onto the **correct** combinatorial object: the prize is exactly
the Sumset-Extremality floor (`#bad ≤ poly·sumset ≤ ε*·|F|`), not the refuted `|Σ_r| ≤ budget`. -/

/-- **Full non-vacuity — the re-targeted reduction is NOT vacuous.** We instantiate
`prize_reduces_to_SumsetExtremality` on the concrete model `modelD` (`n=16, ρ=1/4, k=4`, proven
edge `Dedge 4 = 97 > 16 = soundness`), with the open `SumsetExtremality` satisfied at the binding
fold `3` (`#bad = modelD 16 3 = 0 ≤ poly·sumset ≤ soundness`). EVERY discharged hypothesis is met by
`decide`/`rfl`-level facts and the conclusion `1 − √(1/4) < δ* < 1 − 1/4` (i.e. `1/2 < δ* < 3/4`,
with `δ* = 9/16` here, the corrected/verified pin) is *derived* — confirming the discharged
hypotheses are jointly consistent with the correct open floor, so the reduction is genuine. -/
