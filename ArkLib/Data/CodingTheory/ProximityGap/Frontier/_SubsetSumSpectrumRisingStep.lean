# The rising-half second-difference recurrence of the subset-sum spectrum (#444)

For the 2-power subgroup `μ_n` (`n = 2^μ`, `m = n/2`) the depth-`r` char-0 subset-sum spectrum
cardinality `N_r = spectrumCount m r` (the deep-band bad-scalar count `#bad_r`, via the in-tree
`_SubsetSumSpectrumClosedForm`) satisfies, on the **rising half** `2 ≤ r ≤ m`, the exact
two-step recurrence

```
N_r − N_{r−2}  =  C(m, r) · 2^r.
```

**Mechanism (NOT a moment method).** `spectrumCount m r` filters `k ∈ {0,…,min(r,2m−r)}` on the
parity class `k ≡ r (mod 2)`. On the rising half `min(r,2m−r)=r` and `min(r−2,2m−(r−2))=r−2`, and
the two parity classes coincide (`r` and `r−2` are congruent mod 2). So the two sums run over the
**same parity class** but `range (r+1)` vs `range (r−1)`. The only index added going from `r−2` to
`r` that survives the parity filter is `k = r` itself (`k = r−1` is the *wrong* parity), whose term
is `C(m,r)·2^r`. This is the **leading antipodal cross-polytope term** of `N_r`: the recurrence
says each two-step rise of the spectrum is *exactly* the top antipodal term, with no lower-order
mixing. It exposes `N_r = Σ_{j≥0} C(m, r−2j)·2^{r−2j}` (the parity-class partial sum) and pins the
dominant part `C(m,r)·2^r` of the deep-band census.

Probe `scripts/probes/probe_spectrum_rising_step.py` (exact big-int, thin tower m=8,16,32,64,
never n=q−1): `N_r − N_{r−2} = C(m,r)·2^r` for every `2 ≤ r ≤ m`, and `N_r = Σ_j C(m,r−2j)2^{r−2j}`,
VERDICT PASS.

**HONESTY.** This is the char-0 spectrum recurrence; it does NOT close CORE. At the binding depth
`r = ρn+1` the `F_p` count is collision-saturated and `p`-dependent (BGK/BCHKS wall), where this
char-0 identity no longer transfers. It is a structural census brick extending the in-tree
`spectrumCount`, NOT a moment/energy method and NOT a beyond-Johnson / capacity claim. Issue #444.
