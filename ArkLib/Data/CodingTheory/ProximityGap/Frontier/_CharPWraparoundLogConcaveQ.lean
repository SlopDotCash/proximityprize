# Discharging the wraparound gap `Q ≥ 0` from wraparound LOG-CONCAVITY (#444)

`_CharPTransferDecomposition` reduced the open char-`p` step-ratio wall to two localized
wraparound-control inputs fed into `charP_transfer_of_dominance`:

  1. `0 ≤ G₀ + L`  (the proven char-0 gap dominates the linear wraparound perturbation),
  2. `0 ≤ Q`       where `Q = gap s wa wb wc = (s+2)·wb² − s·wa·wc`  is the wraparound's OWN
                   log-convexity gap (`wa = W_r, wb = W_{r+1}, wc = W_{r+2} ≥ 0` the wraparound
                   excesses `W_r = E_r(F_p) − E_r(ℂ)`).

Input (2), `Q ≥ 0`, was previously carried as a blind machine-confirmed hypothesis. This file
DISCHARGES it from a strictly cleaner, sharper, probe-verified arithmetic condition: the
**wraparound sequence is itself log-concave**, `wa·wc ≤ wb²`. Under that single inequality (plus
the elementary `0 ≤ s`, true since `s = 2r+1`), the wraparound gap is not merely `≥ 0` but
**`≥ 2·wb²`** — a *strict* margin whenever the middle wraparound `wb ≠ 0`.

## Mechanism (one line of arithmetic)

`Q = (s+2)·wb² − s·(wa·wc) ≥ (s+2)·wb² − s·wb² = 2·wb² ≥ 0`,
using `wa·wc ≤ wb²` and `s ≥ 0` (so `−s·(wa·wc) ≥ −s·wb²`).

## Probe receipt (`scripts/probes/probe_charp_wraparound_logconcave_Q_v2.py`)

EXACT integer additive-energy ladders `E_r(F_p)` (modular conv) and `E_r(ℂ)` (CYCLOTOMIC
ANTIPODAL reduction, the in-tree `Er_C_2power`) over `n = 8,16,32,64`, seven structured
prize-regime primes `p ~ n⁴ ≫ n³`, proper subgroups `μ_n ⊊ F_p^*`. Result: `W_r ≥ 0` everywhere;
**wraparound log-concavity `W_r·W_{r+2} ≤ W_{r+1}²` holds at every interior `r`, every prime**
(including the non-vacuous post-onset cases `n=16,p=65537,r=3,4` with `W_4=4480, W_5=2923920,
W_6=1248322944`, and `n=32,r=3` with genuinely positive `W`); and the resulting `Q ≥ 0`. So the
condition this file assumes is empirically forced in the prize regime, not larped.

NOTE: the original probe (`..._Q.py`, now fixed in place) used a naive integer-lift for `E_r(ℂ)`
which is wrong at `r≥4`; the corrected antipodal `E_r(ℂ)` (v2) gives the robust verdict above. The
theorems below are pure algebra (`wa·wc ≤ wb² ⟹ Q ≥ 0`) and are unaffected by the arithmetic fix.

## Honest scope

This converts ONE of the two open wraparound hypotheses (`Q ≥ 0`) into a consequence of the
sharper `wa·wc ≤ wb²`. It does NOT close CORE: the wraparound log-concavity `wa·wc ≤ wb²` itself
remains a measured (probe-true) but UNPROVEN arithmetic input at deep `r` — exactly the BGK/Paley
char-`p` wall, now relocated to a cleaner single-inequality form. No cancellation / completion /
moment-saving / capacity claim. CORE stays OPEN. This is a constraint/reduction sharpening
(door-iv Lane-2/Lane-3).

⚠ ROUTE STATUS (2026-06-20): although `Q ≥ 0` is a valid algebraic lemma, its PARTNER hypothesis in
the `charP_transfer_of_dominance` assembly — the dominance `0 ≤ G₀ + L` — is FALSE in the prize regime
(`_CharPStepRatioMonotoneFails.lean`: the char-`p` step-ratio gap `G_p = G₀ + L + Q` is NEGATIVE at
`n=32, p=786433, r=3` and `n=64, p=2752513, r=2`). So this char-`p`-transfer ROUTE does NOT close CORE;
the `Q ≥ 0` lemma here stands as a kernel identity but has no satisfiable partner on this route.

/-- **The wraparound gap `Q` is `≥ 2·wb²` under wraparound log-concavity.** If the wraparound
sequence is log-concave at this depth (`wa·wc ≤ wb²`) and `0 ≤ s` (true for `s = 2r+1`), then the
wraparound's own log-convexity gap `Q = gap s wa wb wc = (s+2)·wb² − s·wa·wc` is at least `2·wb²`.
This is the structural strengthening: the gap is not merely nonneg, it carries a `2·wb²` margin. -/

`0 ≤ gap s wa wb wc` of `charP_transfer_of_dominance` follows from `0 ≤ s` and the single

endpoint: a single nonvanishing middle wraparound excess forces strict wraparound monotonicity. -/

step-ratio gap is nonneg given (a) the char-0 backbone dominates the linear wraparound perturbation
(`0 ≤ G₀ + L`), and (b) the wraparound sequence is log-concave (`wa·wc ≤ wb²`) with `0 ≤ s`. This
replaces the blind `0 ≤ Q` assumption by the sharper, probe-verified `wa·wc ≤ wb²`. -/
