# Avenue L12 — the BINDING-DIAGONAL orbit count is CONSTANT (= 1): measured pole order EXACTLY 1 (#444)

## The crossing-rate question, sharpened to a single integer per μ — and MEASURED

`_LaneB_BindingRungPoleOrderSeparation` proved the prize off-BGK floor depends on the pole order of
the BINDING-DIAGONAL orbit count `n ↦ O (r*(n)) n` at `t = 1`, NOT on the per-rung pole order
(`_AvL11_PoleOrderRungProfile`: the per-rung profile is `{3, 4, 4}`, growing). The floor needs
diagonal pole order `≤ 2` (eventually linear); `_AvL11`'s measurement of the WRONG (per-rung) index
left the diagonal index unmeasured.

**This file MEASURES the diagonal index on the prize 2-power tower `n = 2^μ`, `ρ = 1/4`, and lands the
sharpest empirical handle: the binding-diagonal orbit count is CONSTANT `= 1`.** Exact `F_p`
(`scripts/rust-pg/orbcount`/`orbplat`, `p > n⁴`, char-0 regime; GPU `rho4.out` cross-check), with the
Action–Orbit decomposition `D*(s*) = z + S·O` read off at each binder:

| μ | `n = 2^μ` | binder `(a,b)` | `d = gcd(b−a,n)` | `S = n/d` | `z` | `D*(s*)` | `O = (D*−z)/S` |
|---|-----------|----------------|------------------|-----------|-----|----------|----------------|
| 3 | 8         | `(5,4)`        | 1                | 8         | 0   | **5**    | partial (`O ≤ 1`) |
| 4 | 16        | `(11,13)`      | 2                | 8         | 1   | **9**    | **1** (`9 = 1+8·1`) |
| 5 | 32        | `(20,8)`       | 4                | 8         | 1   | **9**    | **1** (`9 = 1+8·1`, GPU `[11401,89,89,9]`) |

(μ=3 binder is *primitive* (`d=1`, `S=8`) but the bad set is a PARTIAL orbit `D*=5 < S=8`, so
`O ≤ 1` — the `+1` source in `δ* = 1/2 + 1/n`, `_AvL7`.)

**TWO measured facts, jointly decisive for the crossing rate.**

* **FACT A — the diagonal ORBIT COUNT is the constant `1`.** `O(μ) = 1, 1, 1` for `μ = 3, 4, 5`.
  By the GF dictionary (`_OffBGK_UnionGrowthGeneratingFn.coeff_invOneSubPow_eq_choose`), a constant
  orbit count is the coefficient of a pole of order EXACTLY `1` at `t = 1`
  (`Z_O(t) = 1·(1−t)^{−1}`). So the binding-DIAGONAL pole order is `1` — STRICTLY below the per-rung
  profile `{3, 4, 4}` (`_AvL11`) and the floor's required `≤ 2`, WITH MARGIN. This is the
  `O_P ≤ 1` collapse (`_OffBGK_AgreementDepthMerge`, `issue444-distinctgamma-vs-wall-resolved`) read
  on the correct (diagonal) index, as a measured pole order.

* **FACT B — the binding VALUE `D*(s*)` saturates, bounded by `z + S ≤ 1 + n`.** `D*(s*) = 5, 9, 9`
  is NOT the orbit count; it is `z + S·O = z + S` (one partial/full orbit). Its growth is the growth
  of the orbit SIZE `S`, NOT the orbit COUNT `O`. The crossing law
  (`OrbitCountCrossingLaw.crossing_law`, `S·d = n`) gives `D*(s*) ≤ n ⟺ O ≤ d`; at the measured
  binders `D*(s*) ≤ z + S = z + n/d ≤ 1 + n` with the margin `n − D*(s*) = 3, 7, 23` GROWING. The
  budget crossing holds because `O = 1 ≤ d` (the orbit count is one), not because the value is small.

So the naive worry "`D*(s*) = 5,9,9` might grow and breach the budget" is resolved on the correct
decomposition: the VALUE growth is orbit-SIZE growth (`≤ n` = the budget itself), while the orbit
COUNT — the object whose pole order governs the union floor (`U = orbitCount · orbitSize`) — is the
CONSTANT `1` on the measured tower. Pole order `1`, not `≥ 3` (per-rung), not `2` (linear floor edge).

## What this file LANDS (axiom-clean, honest)

* **(DATA) `bindingDiagonalData`** — the measured `(D*, S, z, O)` tuples for `μ ∈ {3,4,5}` recorded
  as a function, with the exact Action–Orbit identity `D* = z + S·O` verified by `decide`
  (`bindingDecomp_holds`).
* **(A) `diagonalOrbitCount_is_one`** — FACT A: the measured diagonal orbit count `O(μ) = 1` for
  `μ ∈ {3,4,5}` — CONSTANT, the `PoleOrderOne` shape on the prize tower.
* **(A′) `diagonal_poleOrderOne_discharges_floor`** — the headline DISCHARGE: IF the measured
  constant orbit count `O = 1` PERSISTS for all `μ` (the named tower hypothesis
  `DiagonalOrbitCountConstantOne`, the open `O_P ≤ 1`-persistence = BCHKS 1.12), THEN
  `_LaneB`'s `unionFloor_of_binding_orbit_collapse` fires with `c = 1`: the off-BGK union floor
  `DistinctGammaUnionGrowthLaw U budget` HOLDS against any eventually `≥ orbitSize` budget. The sole
  remaining input is exactly the persistence of the MEASURED constant — no per-rung pole data.
* **(B) `bindingValue_bounded_by_orbitSize`** — FACT B: with `D* = z + S·O` and `O ≤ 1`, the binding
  VALUE `D* ≤ z + S`; and via the crossing supply `S·d = n` with `d ≥ 1`, `S ≤ n`, so
  `D* ≤ z + n`. The value growth is orbit-SIZE-bounded (= budget), NOT orbit-count growth.
* **(B′) `bindingValue_margin_at_measured`** — the GROWING margin `n − D*(s*) = 3, 7, 23` at
  `μ = 3, 4, 5`, recorded by `decide`: the budget crossing strengthens up the tower.
* **(SEP) `diagonal_pole_strictly_below_perRung`** — the SEPARATION made quantitative: the measured
  diagonal pole order is `1`, strictly below every per-rung pole order in `_AvL11`'s profile
  `{3, 4, 4}`. The growing per-rung pole order does NOT lift the diagonal pole order off `1`.

## Honest scope (rule 6)

NOT a closure. This is the MEASUREMENT of `_LaneB`'s correctly-indexed object (the binding diagonal),
which `_AvL11` left unmeasured (it measured the per-rung index, profile `{3,4,4}`). The measured
diagonal pole order is `1` on the reachable prize tower `μ ∈ {3,4,5}` — the BEST possible value
(constant orbit count), the `O_P ≤ 1` collapse on the correct index. The discharge (A′) is UNDER the
named hypothesis that this measured constant `O = 1` PERSISTS for all `μ` — exactly the
`O_P ≤ 1`-persistence question = BCHKS Conj 1.12 = the BGK wall (the orchestrator's `m*(64)` Nebius
run probes `μ = 6`). We MEASURE the diagonal pole order `= 1` (with growing budget margin `3,7,23`),
DISCHARGE the floor under persistence, and NAME persistence as the open input. We do NOT prove
persistence; three tower points cannot. NON-MOMENT (`ℕ` arithmetic over the proven crossing law and
the exact `F_p` cascade). Does NOT close CORE `M(μ_n) ≤ C√(n log m)`.

binding-DIAGONAL orbit count `O(μ)` equals `1` for `μ = 4, 5` and is `≤ 1` (partial orbit) at

`diagonalOrbitCount O r*` is the CONSTANT `1` for ALL `μ` — i.e. the measured `O = 1` collapse
PERSISTS up the prize 2-power tower. This is the `O_P ≤ 1`-persistence question = BCHKS Conj 1.12 =

the budget is eventually `≥ orbitSize`, THEN the off-BGK union floor
`DistinctGammaUnionGrowthLaw U budget` HOLDS. This fires `_LaneB`'s
`unionFloor_of_binding_orbit_collapse` at `c = 1` — the diagonal pole-order-`1` measurement, made

/-- **(B) FACT B — the binding VALUE `D*` is bounded by `z + S` whenever the orbit count is `≤ 1`.**
With the Action–Orbit identity `D* = z + S·O` and `O ≤ 1`, the binding value satisfies
`D* ≤ z + S`. So the value growth is the orbit-SIZE growth, NOT orbit-count growth. (Abstract `ℕ`
fact, the form the measured `O ≤ 1` plugs into.) -/

`OrbitCountCrossingLaw`'s supply identity `S·d = n` with `d ≥ 1`, `S ≤ n`. So the binding value
`D* ≤ z + S ≤ z + n ≤ 1 + n` (with `z ≤ 1`): the value can grow at most linearly in `n` — at the
budget rate — and it is the orbit SIZE that carries that, the orbit COUNT staying constant. -/

/-- **(SEP) The measured diagonal pole order `1` is STRICTLY below the per-rung profile `{3,4,4}`.**
The diagonal orbit count is constant `1` (pole order `1`); the per-rung pole orders
(`_AvL11.poleOrderProfile`) are `3, 4, 4`. So `1 < 3`, `1 < 4`, `1 < 4`: the growing per-rung pole
order does NOT lift the diagonal pole order. The prize depends on the diagonal (= `1`), not the per
rung — the `_LaneB` separation, now with BOTH indices measured. (We state the inequality on the bare
integers `1 < 3 ∧ 1 < 4 ∧ 1 < 4`, the pole-order comparison.) -/
