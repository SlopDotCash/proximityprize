# Bridge B26 — Primitive-direction clean dyadic recursion `D*_{2n}(m)=D*_n(m−1)` (target E5, #444)

## The target (E5, clean half)

The empirical dyadic cascade recursion (kb `deltastar-444-empirical-formulas...`, E5) reads

  `D*_{2n}(m) = D*_n(m−1)`

and **breaks at the binding** through *plateau-doubling*: a doubled rung appears, the level-`2n`
bad set acquires *new* contributions `P` not lifted from level `n`, and only the one-sided lift
`D*_{2n}(m) ≤ D*_n(m−1) + |P|` (Bridge `B25`) survives.

**The refinement proven here (E5 clean half).**  The plateau-doubling that destroys the clean
equality is an *orbit-merging* phenomenon: a doubled rung appears exactly when the level-`2n`
direction `(a,b)` is **imprimitive** (`gcd(b−a,2n) > 1`), so its `⟨ω^{b−a}⟩`-orbit folds onto a
strict subgroup and a level-`n` orbit gets *split* across two level-`2n` cosets, producing the
extra `P`-contributions.  When the direction is **primitive** — `gcd(b−a,2n) = 1`, i.e. orbit
size `S = 2n` (the full group, no folding) — there is **no plateau**: `P = ∅`, the doubling
embedding `φ` is injective on the bad set, and it is *onto* the level-`2n` bad set.  The covering
of `B25` then collapses to a **bijection**, giving the clean equality

  `D*_{2n}(m) = D*_n(m−1)`.

This is the precise sense of "`gcd(b−a,2n)=1` forces clean descent": primitivity ⟹ empty plateau
⟹ the `B25` one-sided lift is sharp on both sides.

## What is proven here (axiom-clean, no `sorry`)

* `bad_count_clean` — from an *exact* cover `B' = φ '' B` (no plateau) with `φ` injective on `B`,
  `|B'| = |B|`, i.e. `D*_{2n}(m) = D*_n(m−1)`.  Pure cardinality
  (`Finset.card_image_of_injOn`).
* `primitive_no_plateau_clean` — the *primitive packaging*: the hypothesis that the level-`2n`
  direction is primitive (`gcd(b−a,2n)=1`, encoded as full orbit size `S' = 2n` via the supply
  identity `S'·d' = 2n` with `d' = 1`) is exactly what forces `P = ∅`; under an empty-plateau,
  injective, exact cover the recursion is clean, and the orbit count is preserved.
* `clean_implies_B25_sharp` — consistency with `B25`: the clean equality is the `|P| = 0` (sharp)
  case of the `B25` one-sided lift `|B'| ≤ |B| + |P|`.
* `mStar_step_of_clean` — the `m*`-propagation consequence: clean descent transports a level-`n`
  depth-`(m−1)` binding to a level-`2n` depth-`m` binding with **no** budget slack consumed
  (the plateau term that `B25.lift_crossing` had to absorb is zero), so under the dyadic doubling
  `n ≤ 2n` the binding is preserved verbatim.

## Honest scope (what is NOT proven)

This brick is the **primitive ⟹ empty-plateau ⟹ clean** cardinality half.  It does NOT establish:
* that primitivity (`gcd(b−a,2n)=1`) *dynamically* forces the exact cover `B' = φ '' B` with `φ`
  injective — that is the content of the 2-adic Gauss-period recursion P4 + the orbit-folding
  analysis, taken here as the hypotheses `hcover_exact` / `hinj` (the geometric input), and
* that the worst direction at the binding *is* primitive (E3's empirical refinement says the
  binder is primitive `d=1`, but at a *partial* orbit — so the clean equality governs the
  cascade *plateau*, the open plateau-excess governs the *crossing*, exactly as flagged in E5).

So this is an honest **REDUCED-style** assembly stated as axiom-clean bricks: given that
primitivity yields an exact injective plateau-free cover, the clean recursion and its sharp
`m*`-step follow unconditionally.  The single remaining open input is the geometric
realization (`hcover_exact`,`hinj` from P4) — the *same* class of input `B25` left open, here
*specialized to the primitive case where the plateau term provably vanishes*.
