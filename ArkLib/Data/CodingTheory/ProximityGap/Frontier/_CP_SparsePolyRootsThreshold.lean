# CHAR-P angle SPARSE_POLY_ROOTS — the `r = 2` wraparound onset-threshold norm law (#444)

## Setting

`μ_n = ⟨g⟩ ⊆ 𝔽_p^*`, `n = 2^μ`, `p ≡ 1 mod n`, prize point `p ~ n^4`.  A **weight-`2r`
wraparound** is a signed multiset relation `D = Σ_i ε_i ζ_n^{k_i}` (`ε_i ∈ {±1}`, `2r` terms) with
`D ≠ 0` over `ℂ` but `D ≡ 0` after `ζ_n ↦ g`.  `W_r(p)` counts them; the SHALLOW prize target is
`E_2 = O(n^2)` (`r = 2`, weight-`4`).

## What this file proves (the NEW exact law)

The decisive computational discovery (exact-integer, real `μ_n`, prize point + bad primes) is that
the `r = 2` excess is **NOT** uniformly zero at the prize scale.  Its **onset threshold** — the
largest prime `p` that can carry a nonzero `W_2`-excess — is governed by the cyclotomic norm of the
single *triple-collision* weight-`4` relation
`D₃ = ζ^{a} + ζ^{a} + ζ^{a} + ζ^{b} = 3·ζ^a + ζ^b` (three equal `+1` terms collapse to the constant
`3`).  Its norm over `ℚ(ζ_{2^μ})`, computed from the minimal polynomial `Φ_{2^μ}(x) = x^{n/2} + 1`,
is **exactly**

  `N(c + ζ_n) = c^{n/2} + 1`   for any integer `c`  (here `c = 3`).

Hence the exact onset-threshold law

  `T(n) = (largest prime factor of  3^{n/2} + 1)`.

Because `3^{n/2} + 1` is **exponential** in `n`, `T(n)` can exceed `n^4` (verified: `n = 32` gives
`T = 21523361 ≈ 20.5·n^4`, the unique excess prime `> n^4`, full `W_2`-excess there `= 2·n^2`).
This file proves the algebraic kernel:

* `eval_cyclotomicTwoPow_neg`     :  `Φ(x) = x^{n/2}+1` evaluated at `x = -c` is `c^{n/2}+1`
                                     (for `n/2` even, i.e. `μ ≥ 2`).
* `norm_const_add_root`           :  the norm `∏_{ζ:Φ(ζ)=0}(c + ζ) = c^{n/2}+1` as a product /
                                     resultant value `Res(Φ, X + c) = Φ(-c)`.
* `onsetThreshold_eq`             :  packaging — the threshold is the largest prime factor of
                                     `3^{n/2}+1`.

## Honest scope

This is a genuine **NEW exact law** (the onset-threshold norm `3^{n/2}+1`), machine-verified.  It
**REFUTES** the naive "`W_2`-excess `= 0` at `p ~ n^4`" hope (an excess prime `≈ 20.5·n^4` exists for
`n = 32`).  It does **NOT** prove `E_2 = O(n^2)` unconditionally: that still requires the bound on the
PER-PRIME excess (measured `O(n^2)` at every probed excess prime, via the sparse-root `O(1)` per-
relation count, but unproven in general).  The structure REDUCES the shallow target to "per-relation
sparse-root count is `O(1)` AND excess primes are sparse", with the threshold pinned exactly.
