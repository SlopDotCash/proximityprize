# Door-(iv): the per-level wall-growth floor ITERATES to a super-`√n` tower lower bound — IF SUSTAINED (#444)

A pure-induction companion to `_DoorIVWorstBPerLevelGrowthFloor`.  That file proved a CONDITIONAL
per-level floor: at the coherent worst frequency, under the measured imbalance band (`r_lo`) and
near-worst sub-transfer (`ε`), `M(μ_n) ≥ c · M(μ_{n/2})` with `c = (1+r_lo)(1−ε)`, and the probe
measured `c ≈ 1.46–1.74 > √2` at `n = 16/32/64`.

This file records the **honest iteration**: a chain bound `M_{k+1} ≥ c · M_k` (the per-level floor at
every level `k = 0..a−1` of the dyadic tower `μ_1 ⊂ μ_2 ⊂ … ⊂ μ_{2^a}`) **multiplies** to
`M_a ≥ c^a · M_0`.  Taking `c > √2` (so `log₂ c > 1/2`) and `M_0 = M(μ_1) = 1` this is `M(μ_{2^a}) ≥
c^a = (2^a)^{log₂ c} = n^{log₂ c}` with `log₂ c > 1/2` — a **super-`√n` lower bound**.

## HONESTY (this is a CONDITIONAL, NOT a CORE claim or an asymptotic over-claim)

The hypothesis is exactly "the per-level floor `c` holds at EVERY level down the tower".  This is
**measured** at the probed levels (`n=16/32/64`), **not proven** to persist as `n → ∞`.  Asserting the
super-`√n` conclusion unconditionally would be precisely the kind of "`δ* → capacity`" over-claim the
campaign has refused (and Shaw refuted once).  So this file formalizes ONLY the implication
"sustained per-level floor `⟹` tower lower bound", a pure-arithmetic certainty.  It does NOT bound
`M(n)` from above (not CORE) and makes NO claim that the floor `c > √2` persists asymptotically.  The
value is making explicit that **the prize is exactly the question of whether the per-level floor is
sustained**: a sustained `c < √2` would be needed for the prize `√n`, while the measured `c > √2` (if
sustained) overshoots it — the open object is the floor's asymptotic behaviour, nothing else.

No CORE, cancellation, completion, moment, anti-concentration, or capacity claim.  CORE remains OPEN.

/-- **Tower iteration (ℕ-indexed chain).**  If a nonneg chain `M : ℕ → ℝ` satisfies the per-level
floor `c · M k ≤ M (k+1)` for all `k < a` with `0 ≤ c`, then `c^a · M 0 ≤ M a`.  The per-level

/-- **Strict super-`√n` overshoot under a sustained `c > √2` floor.**  If the chain floor holds with a
constant `c` and `M 0 > 0`, then `M a ≥ c^a · M 0`.  Specialized: with `√2 < c` (the measured floor),
`c^a > (√2)^a = (2^a)^{1/2} = √(2^a)` — the tower value strictly exceeds the `√n` Plancherel scale at
every depth `a ≥ 1`. -/
