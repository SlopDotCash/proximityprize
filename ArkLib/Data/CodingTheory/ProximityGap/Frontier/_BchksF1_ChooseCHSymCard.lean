# Bchks F1c — the IMAGE-CARD reduction: `#bad ≤ chooseCH s r` via a monomial-direction injection

`_BchksF1b_ChooseCHMultisetGrounding` GROUNDED the floor multiplier as the monomial count
(`chooseCH s r = Fintype.card (Sym (Fin s) r)` — there are exactly `chooseCH s r` degree-`r`
monomial multisets over an `s`-node alphabet). That grounding is a *cardinality of the index set*.
This file turns it into the floor's actual *bounding mechanism*: the `poly = 1` leading-order
ceiling `#bad ≤ chooseCH s r`, discharged by a genuine cardinality argument
(`Fintype.card_le_of_injective` / `Finset.card_image_of_injOn`) when the bad set injects into
`Sym (Fin s) r`.

## The mechanism (ABF26 §4 + SchurLagrangeBridge)

At the minimal witness `|R| = k+1`, the forced bad scalar of the far pencil `(x^a, x^b)` is
`γ = −h_{a−k}(R)/h_{b−k}(R)`, with `h_d` the degree-`d` complete-homogeneous symmetric polynomial —
i.e. a SUM over degree-`d` monomials, each indexed by an element of `Sym (Fin s) d`. If distinct bad
scalars arise from distinct monomial directions (the injection hypothesis `hφ`), the bad count is
cut by the number of directions `= chooseCH s r` (the grounded `Sym` cardinality). This is the
`poly = 1` leading order of the F1 floor with a real combinatorial witness — NOT a free `≤`.

⚠️ **The injection is exactly where `poly = 1` can FAIL.** The distinct-`h`-VALUE count over
`(k+1)`-subsets is empirically NOT bounded by `chooseCH n r` at small `r` (`poly = 1` FALSE,
`poly = n` verified — F1 `poly(n)=n` fix; constraint lemma in `DISPROOF_LOG.md` O237). So this file
supplies the leading-order mechanism (`poly = 1` GIVEN injectivity) while the empirical `poly = n`
excess lives precisely in the non-injective small-`r` value-collision region (the genuine open
core).

## Honest scope (rules 1,3,6)

This is the F1 ceiling's reduction MECHANISM, not the open core. It says only "an injection into the
`chooseCH s r` monomial directions caps the bad count" — pure char-free cardinality, NO field
arithmetic / thinness. It does NOT prove the open `CompleteHomogeneousSpectrumBound` (which needs
`poly = n`). Field-universal, so by rule 3 it CANNOT prove CORE. NO moment/census/orbit/spectrum
re-derivation; a `Fintype.card`/`Sym` object, NOT a `δ*`/incidence object — asymptotic-guard
cliff-at-`n/2` UNTOUCHED, no capacity/beyond-Johnson/growth-law claim.
CORE `M(μ_n) ≤ C√(n log(p/n))` OPEN.

monomial direction), then `|B| ≤ chooseCH s r`. The `poly = 1` floor, discharged by genuine
