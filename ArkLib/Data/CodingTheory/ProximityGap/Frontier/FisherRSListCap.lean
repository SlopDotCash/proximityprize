# The Fisher list cap, INSTANTIATED on the Reed-Solomon code (#444, the named-but-unproven
`listCap_Fisher`)

`FisherPastJohnsonCap` proves the abstract set-system bound and DESCRIBES, in its docstring, a
`listCap_Fisher` "coding-theory phrasing", but never states it as a theorem. This file supplies that
instantiation: it feeds the deployed pairwise-intersection cap of the Reed-Solomon code
(`SubJohnsonListDischarge.rsCode_pairwise_agree_le`: two distinct degree-`<k` codewords agree on
`≤ k−1` points) into the level-locked Fisher bound to get the past-Johnson RS list cap directly.

## What is proved (all axiom-clean)

Working with `bigAgreeCodewords dom k m w` (the degree-`<k` codewords agreeing with the center word
`w` on `≥ k+m+1` points, from `SubJohnsonListSupply`):

* **`bigAgree_listAgreeSet_pairwise_inter_le`**: the agreement-sets-with-`w` of two DISTINCT
  codewords in the list intersect in `≤ k−1` points. (A point where both agree with `w` is a point
  where they agree with EACH OTHER, so the intersection embeds in their `≤ k−1` mutual-agreement
  set.)

* **`listAgreeSet_injOn_bigAgree`**: `c ↦ listAgreeSet c w` is INJECTIVE on `bigAgreeCodewords`
  when `k ≥ 1`: two codewords with the same `≥ k+m+1 ≥ k` agreement set coincide
  (`explainer_unique`).
  Hence the realized list size equals the cardinality of the agreement-set family.

* **`rs_listCap_Fisher`** (THE INSTANTIATION): for `k ≥ 1` (the divisor `C(k+m+1, k)` is
  automatically positive since `k ≤ k+m+1`, and the optimal counting level is `a+1 = k`),

  > `(bigAgreeCodewords dom k m w).card · C(k+m+1, k) ≤ C(n, k)`,

  i.e. the past-Johnson RS list at agreement radius `k+m+1` has size
  `≤ C(n, k) / C(k+m+1, k)`. This is the deployed Fisher cap with `t = k+m+1`, `a = k-1`, counted at
  the optimal level `a + 1 = k` (by `level_cap_monotone` from `FisherLevelLocked`). It is valid past
  the Johnson radius (where the second-moment denominator vanishes), and the saturation witness
  (`FisherLevelLocked.fisher_cap_saturated_n8`) shows it is met with EQUALITY by a real thin-`μ_n`
  family. The list count is governed purely by the RS min-distance `a = k-1`; the prize-relevant
  `μ_n` √-cancellation enters NOWHERE in this combinatorial bound.

## Scope (rules 1, 3, 5, 6, honesty contract)

Field-universal: the only code-specific input is the RS pairwise-agreement cap `k-1` (the min
distance), so this holds for ANY code with distance `≥ n-(k-1)`, INDEPENDENT of the domain's
thickness. NOT a CORE proof, NOT thinness-essential. It makes the docstring-named
`listCap_Fisher` an
actual theorem on the RS list, at the optimal counting level, and (with the saturation witness)
records that this combinatorial handle is exhausted: it is Johnson-radius-valid but cannot itself
reach the beyond-Johnson `δ*` margin, which is carried by the `μ_n` √-cancellation. CORE
`M(μ_n) ≤ C·√(n log(p/n))` stays OPEN. Makes NO asymptotic/capacity claim (cliff-at-n/2 untouched).

Axiom-clean (`propext`, `Classical.choice`, `Quot.sound`); no `sorry`.
