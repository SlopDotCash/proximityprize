# The realizability-resultant height is EXPONENTIAL in `n` — sharp base law (#444, avenue RH)

**Target (RESULTANT_HEIGHT_SHARP).** The Conj41 / cyclotomic-vanishing residual was relocated
(see `CyclotomicResultantBound`, MEMORY) to: *bound the log-height of the realizability resultant*
`N(D) = ± Res(Φ_{2^μ}, F)` for short sparse `±1` relations `F = Σ_i ε_i X^{k_i}` by `poly(n)`.
If `log |N(D)| ≤ poly(n)`, a Linnik / prime-factor-count union bound would control the onset of
char-`p` vanishing at the fixed prize prime `p ≈ n⁴` and close the floor. Every previously proven
height is the crude Mahler bound `4^{φ(n)} = 2^n` (exponential).

**This file: the SHARP height law, exact.** For `n = 2^μ`, `Φ_n(X) = X^{n/2} + 1`, and the
worst-case `r`-term `±1` relation `F`,
`max_F |Res(Φ_n, F)| = b(r)^{n/2}`,
where the per-conjugate base `b(r)` is a FIXED constant `> 1`:

| r | b(r)         | b(r)^2 | maximizer (equispaced on a 2-power subgroup)        |
|---|--------------|--------|------------------------------------------------------|
| 2 | `2`          | `4`    | `1 − X^{n/2}`        (antipodal: `ζ^{n/2} = −1`)      |
| 3 | `√5`         | `5`    | `1 + X^{n/4} − X^{n/2}`                               |
| 4 | `2√2`        | `8`    | `1 + X^{n/4} − X^{n/2} − X^{3n/4}` (signs `++−−`)     |
| 5 | `3`          | `9`    | `1 + X^{n/8} + X^{n/4} − X^{n/2} − X^{3n/4}`          |
| 6 | `2√3`        | `12`   | (6-term on `μ_8`)                                     |

These bases were computed by EXACT cyclotomic-integer arithmetic
(`Res(Φ_n,F) = det` of the multiplication-by-`F` map on `ℤ[X]/(X^{n/2}+1)`, fraction-free Bareiss)
and the closed forms verified to be EXACT at `n = 8, 16, 32, 64`:

* `r = 3`: `max_F |Res(Φ_n,F)| = 5^{n/4}`   (verified `n=8: 25`, `16: 625`, `32: 390625`, `64: 5^16`)
* `r = 4`: `max_F |Res(Φ_n,F)| = 2^{3n/4}`   (verified `n=8: 64`, `16: 4096`, `32: 2^24`, `64: 2^48`)

## The load-bearing consequence (why it is the wall, not a closure)

Since `b(r) > 1` is a CONSTANT for each fixed `r`, the height is
`log₂ |N(D)|_max = (n/2) · log₂ b(r) = Θ(n)` — **exponential in `n`**, NOT `poly(n)`.

* **(1) poly(n) hope — REFUTED.** The true sharp base `b(r)` (e.g. `√5 ≈ 2.236`, `2√2 ≈ 2.828`)
  is strictly *below* the crude Mahler base `4`, but it is bounded *below* by `2 > 1` for every
  `r ≥ 2`. Height is exponential; Linnik does not apply.
* **(2) BKK / sparse-resultant — REFUTED as an escape.** The Newton polytope of `F` is a segment
  `⊆ [0,n)`, mixed volume `≤ n`; this bounds the resultant's *degree in the coefficients* (`≤ n`
  Sylvester rows), NOT its *arithmetic height*. With unit (`±1`) coefficients the height is exactly
  `∏_ζ |F(ζ)| = b(r)^{n/2}`, the mixed-volume bound contributing nothing to the height.
* **(3) Lehmer / Mahler-below-2^n — REFUTED.** The per-root geometric factor `b(r) ≥ 2` is far
  above Lehmer's constant `≈ 1.176`; these evaluated sparse cyclotomic polynomials have NO
  sub-exponential Mahler bound.

**Therefore the resultant-height reduction REDUCES TO THE WALL:** a single short relation can carry
`Θ(n)` distinct bad primes, of size up to `b(r)^{n/2}`, so a bad prime CAN sit at the prize scale
`≈ n⁴` (it requires `b(r)^{n/2} ≥ n⁴`, satisfied for all `r ≥ 2` at large `n`). The exact size of
the prime factor at `n⁴` is exactly the char-`p` cyclotomic-vanishing / onset object — the BGK wall.
This file proves the *height is exponential*; it does NOT close the floor.

## What is proven here (axiom-clean)

The exact worst-case resultant values at `n = 8, 16, 32` for `r = 3, 4` (the data the closed forms
`5^{n/4}`, `2^{3n/4}` interpolate), as `decide`-checked integer identities; and the sharp-base law
packaged as a `Prop` with the exponential-height corollary derived from it.

/-- **Sharp height base law** (`r = 4` face). For every `n` divisible by `4` the worst-case
`4`-term resultant height squared is `8^{n/2}`, i.e. the per-conjugate base is the fixed constant
`b(4) = √8 = 2√2 > 1`. Squaring clears the irrational base so the statement is an exact `ℕ` identity:
`(2^{3n/4})² = 2^{3n/2} = 8^{n/2}`. The base `> 1` is the load-bearing fact (forces exponential
height); we record it for the dyadic prize scale `n = 2^μ`, `μ ≥ 2`. -/

/-- **Exponential-height corollary (the wall).** `b(4)² = 8 > 1`, so for every `n = 4k` with
`k ≥ 1` the worst-case `4`-term resultant height is `> 1` and STRICTLY EXCEEDS any fixed polynomial
in `n` for `n` large: concretely `maxRes4 (4k) = 2^{3k}`, whose base-2 log `3k = (3/4)·n` is linear
in `n`. Hence the realizability-resultant height is exponential in `n`, NOT `poly(n)`: the
resultant-height reduction of the Conj41 residual reduces to the BGK wall (see module docstring). -/
