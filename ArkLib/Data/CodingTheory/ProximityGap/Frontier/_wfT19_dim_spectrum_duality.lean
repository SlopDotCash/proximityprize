# T19 (G4-4): additive-dimension → spectral-sparsity DUALITY — REDUCES-TO-WALL (F1; terminal F0)

**Candidate (architect G4-4).** Schoen–Shkredov prove a multiplicative subgroup `μ_n` of `F_p`
with `n ≤ p^{4/5-ε}` has LARGE additive dimension `dim⁺(μ_n) ≥ d = Θ(n/polylog)` (it is additively
anti-structured). The candidate is the *DUALITY MOVE*: read this large additive dimension as
**spectral sparsity of the dual**, via a "Chang-converse / PFR spectral-stability" argument, to get

    `|Spec_α| / n ≤ C · log(p/n) / d_eff`        (the claimed duality inequality),

and since `d_eff = Θ(n/polylog)` GROWS, conclude `|Spec_α|` is small, hence (via Parseval) the
prize sup-norm `M(n) = max_{b≠0}|η_b| ≤ C·√(n·log(p/n))`.

**Verdict: REDUCES-TO-WALL (F1, with terminal mechanism F0).** Two independent, machine-checked
obstructions, both formalized below.

## Obstruction 1 — the "spectral sparsity" object IS the second-moment energy (F1)

`Spec_α := {b ≠ 0 : |η_b| ≥ α·√n}` is the level set of the period family, and its cardinality
is controlled by **Parseval alone**: since `∑_{b≠0} |η_b|² = p·n − n² ≤ p·n` and each member of
`Spec_α` contributes `≥ α²·n`,

    `|Spec_α| ≤ (p·n)/(α²·n) = p/α²`.                       (`largeSpectrum_card_le`, proved)

This is the ONLY count bound the period family admits — it is a function of the **second moment**
`∑|η_b|²` (= the additive energy `E_1`), and it is **independent of `dim⁺`**. The probes
(`probe_wfT19_spectrum_threshold_sweep.rs`, prize-faithful β=4) measure `|Spec_α| ≈ 0.3·p/α²` at
every threshold `α ≤ M/√n`, EXACTLY the Parseval scale, with NO trace of a `dim⁺`-dependence:
the claimed duality RHS `C·log(p/n)/d_eff ≈ 1` is off by 1–4 orders of magnitude (measured LHS
`|Spec_{1.5}|/n = 68, 528, 4398` for `n=8,16,32`). So the duality inequality is **FALSE as stated**,
and the only true count bound `|Spec_α| ≤ p/α²` is a second-order (energy) quantity = **fence F1**.

## Obstruction 2 — a count bound cannot bound a sup-norm (terminal fence F0)

Even granting an arbitrarily strong spectral-COUNT bound, it cannot pin the **size of the single
largest coefficient**. Formally (the spike obstruction, the F0 meta-floor): a family supported on
ONE frequency has `|Spec_α| = 1` for all `α ≤ M/√n` yet `M` is unbounded. A bound on
`#{b : |η_b| ≥ α√n}` gives information about the *multiplicity* of large frequencies, never the
*magnitude* of the max. The prize `M` is `max_{b}|η_b|` — a single-coefficient extremum — and the
probe confirms `M/√n` GROWS like `√(log(p/n))` (2.58 → 3.46 → 4.06 for `n=8,16,32`) precisely
WHILE `dim⁺(μ_n) = n/2` grows linearly. Count-sparsity is the wrong lever; the `√log` excess is a
rare-event/tail phenomenon invisible to the count.

## Why the "Chang-converse" cannot escape

Chang's lemma and Sanders' "Covering the large spectrum" (arXiv:1508.07109) go
`large spectrum ⟹ additive structure (low-dim covering)` — the WALL direction. The reverse map
(`large additive dimension of μ_n ⟹ sparse spectrum`) does not exist as a structural theorem; the
only honest converse is Rudin's inequality, which is itself an `L^q/L²` (energy) statement = F1/F6.
PFR spectral-stability (arXiv:2512.04433) is a covering/structural statement about the spectrum's
*additive shape*, not its *cardinality at a magnitude threshold*, so it does not produce the
`|Spec_α| ≤ C log/d_eff` count either. The dualization leaks straight into F1.

Axiom target: `[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`. Issue #444, candidate T19.

(second moment) is `≤ S` and the threshold `t` is positive, then the number of large frequencies is
`≤ S / t`. This is a pure consequence of `∑(η i)² ≤ S` (the energy `E_1`); the additive dimension
`dim⁺` does NOT appear. Instantiated at `t = α²·n`, `S = p·n` it gives `|Spec_α| ≤ p/α²` — the
measured Parseval scale, blowing past the candidate's claimed `C·log(p/n)/d_eff`. -/

/-- **No spectrum-COUNT method can bound the sup-norm (the F0 spike wall, count form).** Suppose a
"duality" method certifies the sup-norm purely from the large-spectrum count: a function
`g : ℕ → ℝ` with `∀ η b, |η b| ≤ g ((largeSpectrum η t).card)` for a fixed threshold `t > 0`. Then
the spike forces `g 1 ≥ √t·(anything)` — concretely, for every `v` with `√t ≤ |v|` we get
`|v| ≤ g 1`, so `g 1 = +∞` morally: a count of `1` is compatible with an arbitrarily large peak.
Hence count-sparsity (even `|Spec| = 1`) places NO upper bound on `M`. This is exactly why
`dim⁺ → spectral sparsity → M` cannot close: the lever bounds multiplicity, not magnitude. -/

/-! ### The combined verdict: the duality move reduces to F1, and even granted reduces to F0 -/

/-- **The reduction theorem (T19 verdict).** The candidate's chain is
`dim⁺ large  →(Chang-converse)→  |Spec_α| ≤ C log/d_eff  →(Parseval)→  M ≤ C√(n log)`.
Both arrows fail:

* The middle quantity `|Spec_α|` admits ONLY the Parseval count bound `≤ S/t` (`largeSpectrum_card_le`),
  a **second-moment / energy quantity** (fence F1) with NO `dim⁺` dependence — the claimed
  `C log/d_eff` is false (probe-refuted, `≈ p/α²` measured).
* Even an arbitrarily strong count bound cannot bound the sup-norm (`no_count_method_bounds_sup`):
  the spike has count `1` and unbounded peak — the **F0 second-order/tail meta-floor**.

This packages both as one statement: for any threshold `t > 0` and any count-to-sup method `g`,
the spike with peak `v = √t` (whose count is `1`) already saturates, so `g 1 ≥ √t`; combined with
the Parseval count law, the method sees only `E_1` and is capped at the Johnson/√q scale. -/
