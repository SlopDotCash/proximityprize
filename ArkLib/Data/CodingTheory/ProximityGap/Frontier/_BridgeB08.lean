# Bridge B08 — graded bin index halves under doubling (target E6)

The E6 self-similarity `#bad_{2n}(k, 2m') = #bad_n(k/2, m')` and `#bad_{2n}(k, odd) = 0`
rests on a purely arithmetic fact about the doubling map `a ↦ 2·a` on `ℤ/2n` and the
"graded bin index" map `ℤ/2n → ℤ/n` (reduction of a frequency mod the half-modulus).

This file isolates and proves that arithmetic kernel:

* `bin` is the canonical ring hom `ℤ/2n → ℤ/n` (`ZMod.castHom`, valid since `n ∣ 2n`); it
  records the `n`-bin a level-`2n` frequency lands in.
* **`bin_doubling`** — the bin index of `2·a` is twice the bin index of `a`: doubling
  commutes with binning (`bin (2·a) = 2·(bin a)`). This is the "halving" arithmetic: the
  level-`2n` doubled frequency `2a` is graded by the level-`n` frequency `2·bin a`, so the
  doubling map folds the `2n`-grading onto the `n`-grading.
* **`bin_antipodal`** — the antipodal element `n` (the order-2 element `-1 ∈ μ_{2n}`) bins to
  `0`: `bin (n) = 0`. This is the antipodal-involution vanishing that kills odd graded pieces.
* **`antipodal_period_two`** — `2·(n : ℤ/2n) = 0`: the antipode has order dividing 2.

These are char-free residue identities; they are the exact arithmetic substrate the E6
bijection (subset folding) and the odd-piece vanishing are built on.

`2·bin a`, which is what folds the `2n`-graded obstruction onto the `n`-graded one. -/
