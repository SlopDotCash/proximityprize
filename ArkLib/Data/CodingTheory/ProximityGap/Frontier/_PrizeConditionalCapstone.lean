# Prize conditional capstone: the full proven scaffold + the single named open hypothesis (#444)

This file assembles, in one place, the complete reduction chain established this campaign: **the prize follows from a
single named hypothesis** (`SaddleEnergyBound`), and every other link is proven axiom-clean in the cited files. It is
a *conditional theorem* — honest about exactly what remains.

## The chain (each `⟸` is a landed axiom-clean reduction)

   ⟺ (_CharPExcessForcedByFloor / SUBBGK)             SaddleEnergyBound:  Σ_{t≠0}|η_t|^{2r} ≤ (p−1)·E_r(ℂ),  r ≤ log p
```

**Proven unconditionally:** the `r=1` (Parseval) and `r=2` rungs; the entire char-0 backbone; the wraparound-free
regime `r < ½·p^{2/n}` (onset dichotomy, with the tight extremal `(2r)^{n/2}`), which **closes the prize
unconditionally for thin subgroups** (`n < 2 log p / log(2 log p)`, e.g. `n ≤ 32` at `p = 2^128`).

**The single open hypothesis** `SaddleEnergyBound`: `Σ_{t≠0}|η_t|^{2r} ≤ (p−1)·E_r(ℂ)` for `r` up to the saddle
`≈ log p` at large `n`. This is exactly the BGK / di Benedetto / BCHKS conjecture at β=4 (the char-p deep-moment /
Paley-graph bound) — the recognized open problem. **Not proved here**; named so the prize derivation is explicit.

## What this file proves (axiom-clean)

`prize_of_saddleEnergyBound`: the abstract logical core — if the per-frequency energy `S_r` is bounded by the
sub-Gaussian budget `(p−1)·E_r` (the hypothesis) and the char-0 budget is itself sub-Gaussian
(`E_r ≤ Wick_r`, the proven Bessel bound), then the b≠0 moment is sub-Gaussian (`μ_{2r} ≤ Wick_r`), the conclusion
that yields the prize via the moment bound. This packages the whole chain into one implication with the open content
isolated to the single hypothesis. Issue #444.

/-- **The prize from the saddle energy bound (the conditional theorem core).** Let `S_r = Σ_{t≠0}|η_t|^{2r}` (b≠0
energy), `E_r = E_r(ℂ)`, `Wick_r = (2r−1)‼·n^r`, `μ_{2r} = S_r/(p−1)`. Given:
* the **open hypothesis** `SaddleEnergyBound`: `S_r ≤ (p−1)·E_r` (equivalently `μ_{2r} ≤ E_r`), and
* the **proven char-0 anchor**: `E_r ≤ Wick_r` (Bessel-MGF, `_CharZeroMGFBesselBound`),
* with `p > 1`,
then the b≠0 moment is sub-Gaussian: `μ_{2r} ≤ Wick_r`. This is the conclusion that drives the moment bound to the
prize `M ≤ C·√(n log q)`. The entire open content is the first hypothesis (= BGK at the saddle). -/

/-- **The thin-range unconditional branch (no open hypothesis).** Below the wraparound onset (`p > (2r)^{n/2}`, so
the char-p wraparound `W_r = 0`, hence `S_r = (p−1)·E_r` exactly from the Plancherel identity packaged as `hWfree`),
the saddle bound holds with equality, so `μ_{2r} ≤ Wick_r` unconditionally. This is the proven prize for thin
subgroups, requiring NO open hypothesis. -/

/-- **Necessity of the saddle energy bound (contrapositive core).**  The saddle bound is not merely
*sufficient* for the sub-Gaussian moment — modulo the proven char-0 anchor `E ≤ Wick`, it is the
binding obstruction.  Given the proven anchor `E ≤ Wick` and `μ·(p−1) = S` with `p > 1`: if the
sub-Gaussian moment conclusion *fails* (`Wick < μ`), then the saddle energy bound *must* fail too
(`(p−1)·E < S`).  So any violation of the prize-driving conclusion is forced through a violation of
the single open hypothesis — the saddle bound is exactly the load-bearing rung. -/

/-- **The saddle energy bound is exactly `μ_{2r} ≤ E_r`.**  The conditional capstone's docstring states
the saddle hypothesis `S ≤ (p−1)·E` is "equivalently `μ_{2r} ≤ E_r`".  This formalizes that exact
equivalence: since `μ·(p−1) = S` and `p > 1` (so `p−1 > 0`), the saddle bound `S ≤ (p−1)·E` holds iff
the normalized b≠0 moment is at most the char-0 budget, `μ ≤ E`.  No anchor `E ≤ Wick` is used here —
this is the raw normalization equivalence between the saddle bound and the moment-vs-char-0 comparison. -/
