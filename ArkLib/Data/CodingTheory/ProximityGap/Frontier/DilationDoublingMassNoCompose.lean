# The doubling-mass halving does NOT iterate (#444)

`DilationDoublingMassHalf` proves a **single-level** cap: along one genuine disjoint tower step the
L²-weighted **doubling** (`+`-sign) cross-mass is at most `½·q·|G|`
(`plusMass_le_half_card`). Its own honesty note flags the open gap: *"a single frequency may sit on
the `+`-trajectory through MANY levels; the average only forbids ALL of them doing so."* The
natural hope is that the halving **iterates**: that intersecting the `+`-sign condition at a second,
independent tower dilation `ζ'` thins the doubling mass by another factor `½`, giving a geometric
deep-descent cap `plus_ℓ ≤ 2^{-ℓ}·q·|G|`.

**This file proves that hope is FALSE for the obvious "other tower neighbor" choice, with the exact
mechanism.** The two tower neighbors of a frequency `b` are `ζ·b` and `ζ⁻¹·b`; they differ by
`ζ² = ζ·(ζ⁻¹)⁻¹`, and `ζ² ∈ G` for the tower step (`ζ` has order `2n`, `ζ² ∈ μ_n = G`). Since the
period is **`G`-coset-invariant in the frequency** (`eta_smul_invariant`, #389), the second neighbor
carries the *same* period: `η_{ζ⁻¹·b} = η_{ζ·b}` whenever `ζ⁻²·(ζ·b) = ζ⁻¹·b` and `ζ⁻² ∈ G`. Hence
the second `+`-sign condition is **literally identical** to the first, the doubly-doubling mass
equals the singly-doubling mass, and there is **no second halving**.

## The results (extend `eta_smul_invariant` + `crossSign`/`crossMass`/`plusMass`)

* `crossSign_dilate_smul_eq` — `crossSign` is unchanged when the dilation `ζ` is pre-multiplied by a
  `G`-permuting unit `g` (e.g. `g ∈ G`): `crossSign ψ G (g·ζ) b = crossSign ψ G ζ b`.
* `crossMass_dilate_smul_eq` — same for `crossMass`.
* `plusMass_dilate_smul_eq` — hence `plusMass ψ G (g·ζ) = plusMass ψ G ζ`: the doubling mass is a
  **`G`-coset invariant of the dilation**. Two tower dilations that differ by a `G`-element define
  the *same* doubling set and the *same* doubling mass.
* `plusMass_inv_eq` — the concrete deep-descent statement: for the two tower neighbors,
  `plusMass ψ G ζ⁻¹ = plusMass ψ G ζ` whenever `ζ⁻² ∈ G` (`ζ⁻¹ = ζ⁻²·ζ`). Intersecting the
  `+`-condition at `ζ` and at `ζ⁻¹` is intersecting a set with itself — **no second halving**.

## Scope / honesty (refutation-with-mechanism, rule 4)

This is a **negative structural result**: it refutes the "iterated halving via the other tower
neighbor" route to a geometric deep-descent cap, and pins the exact reason (`G`-coset-invariance of
the period collapses the two neighbor conditions to one). It is **probe-confirmed** (exact `F_p`,
PROPER thin `μ_n`, `p≍n⁴`, `n=8..64`, `NEVER n=q-1`): `plus2Mass/plusMass = 1.000` and the mixed
sign-quadrant cross-mass is `0.000` to machine precision (`scripts/probes/probe_doubling_twolevel_*`).
It does **NOT** close CORE and does **NOT** refute the *general* iterated-halving hope for a
*genuinely independent* second dilation `ζ'` outside the `G`-coset of `ζ` and `ζ⁻¹` — it removes the
ONE obvious choice (the other tower neighbor) and explains why. The worst-case single-frequency
deep-descent sign word (the BGK/Paley wall) stays **OPEN**.
