# Bridge B11 [target E3] — the bad-γ set is closed under the dilation `γ ↦ γ·μ^{b−a}`

**Claim (E3 / B11):** the bad-α set of the two-monomial pencil `h_α(z)=z^a+αz^b` on a
multiplicative domain `D` is *closed* under the dilation `α ↦ α·μ^{b−a}` for every `μ ∈ D`
(orbit closure).  "RS-agreement set is dilation-stable."

**Substrate consumed.**
* `ActionOrbitFRI.badSet_orbit_closed` (axiom-clean): the per-element statement —
  if `α` is `w`-bad then `α·μ^{b−a}` is `w`-bad, via `agreement_orbit_invariance`
  (the agreement count is invariant under the dilation).
* `OrbitCountCrossingLaw.pencil_crossing_law` (axiom-clean): the counting consumer of the
  `hmap : ∀ a ∈ B, rep a ∈ B` premise (orbit closure of the bad set).

**What this bridge adds.**  It lifts the *per-element* `badSet_orbit_closed` to the *set-level*
self-map statement `∀ α ∈ badSet, dilate α ∈ badSet` (`badSet_dilation_selfMap`), and packages it
as the `hmap` hypothesis of the crossing-law counting brick.  This is the precise hinge E3 names:
the dilation `γ ↦ γ·μ^{b−a}` maps the bad set into itself, which is exactly what makes it a union
of `⟨μ^{b−a}⟩`-orbits and lets the crossing law convert the incidence-budget test into an
orbit-count test.

`badSet` is `w`-bad-α as a `Finset` over a finite field `F` (so `D ⊆ F`, the dilation map is a
self-map of `F`).  The bad predicate is `∃ g, deg g < k ∧ w ≤ (agreement count at α)`.

## Honest scope

This is a **bridge / reformulation**, not a closure: it converts the per-element orbit invariance
into the set-level closure premise consumed by the crossing law.  The OPEN content (the orbit
*count* `N` staying small at the binding radius — E7 / BCHKS 1.12) is NOT touched here.
Axiom-clean.

/-- **Crossing law fed by the orbit closure (B11 assembled).**  Given:
* the set-level orbit closure of `badSet` under any orbit-representative map `rep` that factors
  through the dilation (concretely, the constant-orbit-size partition of `badSet` into
  `⟨μ^{b−a}⟩`-orbits each of size `S`, with `S·d = n`),
the incidence-budget test on the bad-α count `|badSet| ≤ n` is equivalent to the orbit-count test
`#orbits ≤ d = gcd(b−a, n)`.

The `hmap` premise — "`rep` maps `badSet` into itself" — is the orbit closure that B11 supplies
(`rep` chooses an orbit representative *inside* the same orbit, which `badSet_dilation_selfMap`
keeps inside `badSet`).  This wires E3's dilation stability into the P3 crossing law. -/
