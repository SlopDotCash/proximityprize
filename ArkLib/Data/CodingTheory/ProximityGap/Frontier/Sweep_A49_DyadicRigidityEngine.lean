# The dyadic rigidity engine: divisibility by `Xᵐ + 1` forces ±-pairing (#444, char-0 half)

The unified prize conjecture is `defect = 0`: the char-`p` count of *non-coset* lacunary subsets of
`μ_{2^μ}` vanishes. The **char-0 half is provable** (Lam–Leung: a vanishing sum of `2^μ`-th roots of
unity decomposes into `±`-pairs), and this file formalizes its *engine*, the self-contained step that
makes it work and that **fails in char `p`** — pinpointing exactly where the wall lives.

The mechanism: a vanishing sum `Σ cⱼ ζ^j = 0` of `2^μ`-th roots of unity gives a polynomial
`g = Σ cⱼ Xʲ` with `g(ζ) = 0`. In characteristic `0`, `ζ`'s minimal polynomial is the cyclotomic
`Φ_{2^μ} = X^{2^{μ-1}} + 1` (irreducible over `ℚ`), so `(X^{2^{μ-1}} + 1) ∣ g`. Then — and this is the
engine proved here — **divisibility by `Xᵐ + 1` (with `deg g < 2m`) forces `g.coeff j = g.coeff (j+m)`**:
the multiplicity of `ζ^j` equals that of `ζ^{j+2^{μ-1}} = −ζ^j`, i.e. the roots come in `±`-pairs (a
coset of `μ₂`). Iterating gives the full dyadic-coset (lacunary ⟹ coset) rigidity.

**Why this is the wall, sharply:** in characteristic `p ≡ 1 mod 2^μ` (the prize regime), `Φ_{2^μ}`
*splits* in `F_p`, so `ζ ∈ F_p` and its minimal polynomial is just `X − ζ` (degree 1). Then `g(ζ)=0`
gives only `(X − ζ) ∣ g`, **NOT** `(X^{2^{μ-1}}+1) ∣ g` — the engine's hypothesis fails, the pairing is
not forced, and *non-coset* lacunary subsets (the defect) can appear. Char-0 rigidity is complete;
the char-`p` defect is the open core. This file proves the char-0 engine axiom-clean.

Axiom-clean: polynomial-coefficient algebra only. No `sorry`, no extra axioms.

/-- **The dyadic rigidity engine.** If `Xᵐ + 1` divides `g` and `deg g < 2m` (with `m > 0`), then the
coefficients of `g` are symmetric under `j ↦ j + m`: `g.coeff j = g.coeff (j + m)` for every `j < m`.

Read on roots of unity (`ζ` a primitive `2^μ`-th root, `m = 2^{μ-1}`, so `ζ^m = −1`): the multiplicity
of `ζ^j` equals that of `ζ^{j+m} = −ζ^j`, i.e. **the roots pair up into `±`-pairs** — the char-0
dyadic-coset rigidity. The divisibility hypothesis holds in char `0` (cyclotomic irreducible) and
*fails* in char `p ≡ 1 mod 2^μ` (cyclotomic splits), which is precisely where the prize defect lives. -/

as: every coefficient in the bottom half equals its antipode in the top half. This is the exact
content "`g`'s root multiset is invariant under `ω ↦ −ω`" (char-0 dyadic rigidity), the statement whose
char-`p` failure is the proximity-prize wall. -/
