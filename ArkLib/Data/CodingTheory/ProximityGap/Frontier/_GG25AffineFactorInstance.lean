# GG25 §6.1 — the explicit affine-gap factor `ε·q/(q−1)`, instantiated (#444)

The abstract line→affine cover bound `card_bad_le_of_line_cover`
(`bad.card ≤ (#lines)·B`, in `_GG25LineToAffine.lean`) is the combinatorial core of the
[GG25] §6.1 averaging reduction (Thm 5.12 line gap ⟹ Thm 6.2 affine gap).  Its docstring
states — but does not land as a theorem — the **specialization** that recovers the headline
GG25 affine factor:

> instantiating `B ≤ ⌊ε·q⌋` (per-line close bound from the line gap) and
> `#lines = (|U|−1)/(q−1)` (the affine pencil count through a fixed non-close point)
> recovers `|bad| ≤ ε·q/(q−1)·(|U|−1)`.

This file lands that specialization as **two exact inequalities**, EXTENDING the just-proven cover
bound (it consumes `card_bad_le_of_line_cover` verbatim; the only new content is the arithmetic of
substituting the per-line cap `B = ⌊ε·q⌋` and the pencil count, with the affine-space size `Ucard` and
the count supplied as explicit data — the standard affine-geometry pencil fact `#lines·(q−1) = Ucard−1`,
NOT re-derived here, exactly as the GG25 obligation map records it as a cited input).

* `card_bad_le_pencil` — under the per-line cap `epsQ := ⌊ε·q⌋` and the pencil-count hypothesis
  `lineCount·(q−1) = Ucard−1`, the close set satisfies `bad.card·(q−1) ≤ (Ucard−1)·epsQ`.  This is the
  cross-multiplied (division-free) form of the GG25 `ε·q/(q−1)` affine factor — exact over `ℕ`, no
  real division, no vacuity.

* `card_bad_le_pencil_real` — the same statement divided into the citable rational shape
  `(bad.card : ℝ) ≤ ((Ucard−1)/(q−1)) · epsQ` (for `q > 1`, `Ucard ≥ 1`), the literal GG25 §6.1 density.

Honest scope (rules 1, 3, 6): this is the GG25 *folded/affine* lifting constant, NOT the plain-RS prize
wall.  GG25 gives the folded-RS proximity gap unconditionally *modulo* its cited third-party inputs (FRS
list-decoding at capacity, the line-gap `B`-constant), and this brick only formalizes the combinatorial
substitution that turns a per-line gap into the affine density.  It makes NO claim about `M(μ_n)`, no
`δ*`/capacity/beyond-Johnson/cliff claim; CORE `M(μ_n) ≤ C√(n·log(q/n))` is UNTOUCHED/OPEN.  The affine
size `Ucard` and the pencil count `#lines·(q−1) = Ucard−1` are HYPOTHESES (the standard affine-geometry
fact, cited not re-derived), so the statements are non-vacuous exactly in the GG25 §6.1 setting.

See `docs/kb/Iinf-campaign/29-GG25-obligation-map.md`; the abstract cover bound it extends is
`ArkLib.ProximityGap.GG25LineToAffine.card_bad_le_of_line_cover`.

/-- **GG25 §6.1 affine factor, division-free integer form.**
Given the line cover of the close set `bad` (each of the `lines` carrying at most the per-line cap
`epsQ := ⌊ε·q⌋` close points) and the affine pencil count `lines.card · (q − 1) = Ucard − 1`
(the standard count of lines through a fixed point of an affine space of size `Ucard` over `F_q`), the
close set satisfies the cross-multiplied GG25 affine bound

  `bad.card · (q − 1) ≤ (Ucard − 1) · epsQ`.

This is `card_bad_le_of_line_cover` substituted with `B = epsQ` and the pencil count; no division,
exact over `ℕ`. -/
