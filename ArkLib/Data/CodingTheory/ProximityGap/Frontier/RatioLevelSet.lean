# The rational-function level-set degree bound (δ* ratio-census attack, research-map §4 vector 1)

The `docs/kb/deltastar-research-map.md` ranks the **ratio-census identity** as the #1 never-tried
handle on the open δ* core's line–ball-incidence face (face iv): reduce the incidence of a far
direction with the syndrome ball to the *multiplicity profile of the ratio sequence* of two GRS
syndromes, then bound that profile by the fact that **a generalized-Reed–Solomon syndrome ratio is
a rational function on the smooth domain, so its level sets are root sets and multiplicities are
degree-bounded**. This file lands that algebraic core, axiom-clean and self-contained.

* `ratio_value_mult_le` — for a ratio `R/ℓ` on an injective domain, a fixed value `c` is attained
  at ≤ `max (deg R) (deg ℓ)` domain points (the level set `{x : R(x)/ℓ(x) = c}` injects into the
  roots of the nonzero polynomial `R − c·ℓ`). Hypothesis `R ≠ C c * ℓ` excludes the constant ratio.
* `grs_line_incidence_le` — the attack-facing form: the number of domain points where a combined
  syndrome `s₀ + γ·s₁` vanishes (off the poles of `s₁`) is ≤ `max (deg s₀) (deg s₁)`.

**Honest scope.** This is the *elementary algebraic lever* the ratio-census attack needs — the
degree-bounded level-set fact the general list-decoding wall lacks because it ignores the domain's
GRS structure. It is a boundary brick toward the open core, NOT a closure: the hard residual is the
*census* (`WindowRationalLinear`, `WBPencilLinearBudget.lean`) — bounding the *total* bad-scalar
count across all directions to `≤ n` in the production regime, which this per-direction bound feeds
but does not settle.

Axiom-clean (`propext`, `Classical.choice`, `Quot.sound`); no `sorry`.

/-- **The rational-function level-set degree bound** (research-map §4 vector 1, the algebraic
core). For a ratio `R/ℓ` evaluated on an injective domain, a fixed value `c` is attained at at
most `max (deg R) (deg ℓ)` domain points: those points are roots of `R − c·ℓ`, a nonzero
polynomial of that degree. The hypothesis `R ≠ C c * ℓ` excludes the degenerate constant ratio
(level set = whole domain). This is "incidence ≤ deg-bound on how often a fixed rational function
repeats a value on a (subgroup) orbit" — the GRS syndrome ratio multiplicity bound. -/

/-- **GRS line–ball incidence at one direction, degree-bounded** (research-map §4 vector 1).
For two GRS syndromes given by polynomials `s₀, s₁`, the number of domain points where the
combined syndrome `s₀ + γ·s₁` vanishes (off the poles of `s₁`) is at most `max (deg s₀) (deg s₁)`
— because vanishing of `s₀ + γ·s₁` at `dom i` is the level set `s₀/s₁ = −γ`. The hypothesis
`s₀ ≠ C (−γ) * s₁` excludes the degenerate whole-domain-vanishing direction. This is the exact
"incidence ≤ deg-bound on how often the ratio repeats a value on the orbit" handle the ratio-census
attack needs, made concrete and axiom-clean. -/
