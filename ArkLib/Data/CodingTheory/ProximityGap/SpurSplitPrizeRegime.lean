# The prize-regime (split) weight-3 spurious collision: `Spur_2(17) ≥ 1` in `F_17` (Issue #444)

Companion / prize-regime upgrade of `SpurWeightThreeCollision` (`8fadf6eb1`, the `p = 3`, `m = 3`
witness). That witness proved the p-divisibility tower does not collapse above weight 2, but at a
**non-split** prime: `p = 3 ∤ 2^3 − 1 = 7`, so `μ_8` embeds only in `F_9`, not the prime field `F_3`.
The prize regime is the **split** case `p ≡ 1 mod n` (`q·ε* ≈ n`), where the primitive `n`-th root
`g` lives in the prime field `F_p` itself and only in-`F_p` vanishings contribute to the char-`p`
energy `E_r`. We give the smallest prize-faithful witness.

## The split witness (`m = 4`, `n = 16`, `p = 17`)

`p = 17 ≡ 1 mod 16` is **split** (`16 ∣ 17 − 1`), so `F_17` contains a primitive `16`-th root of
unity — concretely `g = 3` (`3^16 = 1`, `3^8 = −1`, so `ord(3) = 16`). The weight-3 antipodal-free
relation `1 + ζ + ζ⁴` (exponent set `{0,1,4}`, no two differing by `2^{m−1} = 8`) **vanishes at `g`**:

> **`1 + 3 + 3⁴ = 0` in `F_17`**   (and `3⁸ + 1 = 0`, i.e. `g` is a root of `Φ_16 = X⁸ + 1`).

So `Φ_16` and `1 + X + X⁴` share the root `g = 3` in `F_17`: they are NOT coprime in `F_17[X]`, the
prize prime `17` divides `N(1 + ζ + ζ⁴)`, and **the spurious vanishing happens in the prime field**
(`g ∈ F_17`) — a genuine prize-regime spurious collision. Hence `Spur_2(17) ≥ 1` in the split regime.

## Deconfliction with the `p ≡ 3 mod 4` Chebotarev exclusion (`baacb5c69`)

`SpurBadPrimeChebotarev.spur_field_excludes_three_mod_four` shows no `p ≡ 3 mod 4` prime carries `μ_{2^m}`
in the **prime field** `ZMod p` (`−1` is not a square there), so the in-`F_p` spurious set is empty for
that class. The non-split `p = 3` witness (`SpurWeightThreeCollision`) is consistent: `3 ≡ 3 mod 4`, its
collision lives in `F_9` (not `F_3`), and contributes to char-`3` energy only off the prime field. THIS
witness is in the **surviving** class: `17 ≡ 1 mod 4` (and `≡ 1 mod 16`), exactly where the Chebotarev
exclusion leaves the bad-prime set non-empty and the open BCHKS-1.12 wall lives. So the two results
compose cleanly: the `≡ 3 mod 4` half-class is excluded from the in-field support, and `p = 17` exhibits
a concrete surviving (`≡ 1 mod 4`, split) prime where the in-`F_p` spurious count is genuinely `≥ 1`.

## Results (axiom-clean)

* `three_primitive_root_16`   : `g = 3` is a primitive `16`-th root of unity in `F_17` (`3^16 = 1`,
    `3^8 = −1`).
* `phi16_zmod17`              : `Φ_16 = X⁸ + 1` over `F_17`.
* `g_isRoot_phi16`            : `g = 3` is a root of `Φ_16` in `F_17`.
* `g_isRoot_relation`         : `g = 3` is a root of the weight-3 relation `1 + X + X⁴` in `F_17`
    (`1 + 3 + 3⁴ = 0`).
* `split_weight3_not_coprime_mod17` : **THE PRIZE-REGIME WALL RUNG** — `Φ_16` and `1 + X + X⁴` are NOT
    coprime in `F_17[X]` (shared root `g = 3 ∈ F_17`). The split prime `17 ≡ 1 mod 16` divides
    `N(1+ζ+ζ⁴)` and the spurious vanishing is IN THE PRIME FIELD — a genuine prize-regime collision,
    so `Spur_2(17) ≥ 1`.

## Honest scope (rules 1, 3, 6)

NOT a CORE closure. It is the prize-regime-faithful upgrade of the `p = 3` witness: a concrete SPLIT
prime `p ≡ 1 mod n` (so `g ∈ F_p`, the genuine prize regime) at which the in-field spurious-collision
count is `≥ 1`, landing in the surviving `≡ 1 mod 4` Chebotarev class. Together with the weight-2 base
(`Spur = 0` at all odd `p`) and the `≡ 3 mod 4` exclusion, it pins the wall to: **weight `≥ 3`,
`p ≡ 1 mod 4`, split** — the count `Spur_r(p)` at depth `r ≈ log q` in exactly that class. Thinness-
essential in the same mild sense (it is the `16 ∣ 17−1`, `μ_16 ⊆ F_17` prime-power-2 split fact). CORE
(`M(μ_n) ≤ C·√(n·log(p/n))`) stays OPEN.
