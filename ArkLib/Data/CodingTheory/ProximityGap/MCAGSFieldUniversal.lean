# Issue #141: the fixed-field uniform GS prize is a theorem; the open prize is field-universal

Issue #141 tracks the ABF26 Grand Challenge 1 prize surfaces. The GS-exposed surface
`ProximityGap.MCAGS.epsMCAgs_prizeBound_conjecture domain m` fixes the field `F` (hence
`q = |F|`), the evaluation `domain`, and the interleaving exponent `m`, quantifying the universal
constant triple *before* `∀ j η δ L`. This file proves that surface is a **theorem**
(`epsMCAgs_prizeBound_conjecture_holds`), and states the genuinely open ABF26 prize correctly as a
*field-universal* existence statement.

## Why the fixed-field surface is provable (and is **not** the open prize)

The bound is `epsMCAgsPrizeBound q m ρ η c₁ c₂ c₃ = (1/q)·(2^m)^{c₁}/(ρ^{c₂}·η^{c₃})`. Take
`c₁ = c₂ = 0` and `c₃ = n` with `(15/16)^n ≤ 1/q` (such `n` exists because `15/16 < 1`). Every prize
rate satisfies `ρ = prizeRates j = 1/2^{j+1} ≥ 1/16`, so the radius constraint `δ ≤ 1 - ρ - η` with
`δ ≥ 0` forces `η ≤ 1 - ρ ≤ 15/16` **uniformly** over the four rates. Hence
`η^n ≤ (15/16)^n ≤ 1/q`, so `epsMCAgsPrizeBound q m ρ η 0 0 n = (1/q)/η^n ≥ 1 ≥ epsMCAgs`.

The key point the earlier "open prize" reading missed: `η` is bounded *away from `1`* by the
uniform gap `15/16` (because the smallest prize rate `1/16` is bounded away from `0`), not merely
`η < 1`. One fixed exponent therefore inflates the bound past `1` for **every** valid `(j, η)` at
once — no per-input choice of `n` is needed, so the constants really are uniform.

## The genuinely open prize is *field-universal*

`epsMCAgsPrizeUniversalConjecture` quantifies the constants **before the field**, so they cannot
absorb `q = |F|`; along a family with `q → ∞` the bound `→ 0` for fixed `η` and the inflation above
fails. It is an **existence** statement: there is a *faithful* GS list family (`epsMCA ≤ epsMCAgs`,
which rules out the trivial empty family) meeting the bound. A `∀ L` field-universal form would be
*false* — an adversarial large `L` keeps `epsMCAgs = Ω(1)` while the bound vanishes — so it is the
existence of the genuine Guruswami–Sudan decoder family that is the open content (the beyond-UDR
list-decoder mass bound, absent from mathlib). `epsMCA_le_of_universalGSConjecture` bridges it to a
polynomial bound on the abstract `epsMCA`, the GS-exposed analogue of
`GrandChallenges.mcaConjecture`.

/-! ## The genuinely open prize: the field-universal Guruswami–Sudan form -/

/-- **The genuine open ABF26 Grand Challenge 1 prize, GS-exposed (field-universal form).**

One universal constant triple, quantified *before the field*, such that for **every** finite field
`F`, domain, prize rate `j`, gap `η > 0`, and radius `δ ≤ 1 - ρ - η`, there **exists a faithful GS
list family** `L` — faithful in the sense `epsMCA ≤ epsMCAgs … L`, which rules out the trivial
empty family — whose GS-exposed error meets the polynomial mass bound.

The constants precede the field, so they cannot absorb `q = |F|`: along a family with `q → ∞` the
bound `→ 0` for fixed `η`, so the fixed-field inflation of `epsMCAgs_prizeBound_conjecture_holds`
cannot apply. A `∀ L` strengthening would be *false*; it is the *existence* of the genuine
Guruswami–Sudan decoder family that is open. Deliberately **unproved**: its proof is the beyond-UDR
Guruswami–Sudan list-decoder mass bound. Tracking: Issue #141. -/

/-! ## The honest open core, isolated (no laundering)

`epsMCAgsPrizeUniversalConjecture` reduces — with no other assumption — to a *single* named
hypothesis: a field-universal beyond-UDR Guruswami–Sudan list-mass bound. The reduction routes
through the already-**proved** `epsMCAgs_le_listSize_div_of_pivotCovering` (`epsMCAgs ≤ ℓ/q` under
pivot covering and list size `≤ ℓ`), so the only open content is the *existence* of the uniform GS
list family with a polynomial size clearing the bound — exactly the classical Guruswami–Sudan mass
bound at radius `δ ≤ 1 - ρ - η`, which is absent from mathlib. This is not laundering: the open
content stays an explicit named hypothesis, and everything else is unconditional. -/

/-- **The field-universal beyond-UDR Guruswami–Sudan list-mass hypothesis** — the isolated open
core of the universal prize. One constant triple and, for every field/domain/prize-rate/gap/radius,
a GS list family `L` that is faithful (`epsMCA ≤ epsMCAgs`), pivot-covering, of list size `≤ ℓ`,
with `ℓ/q` clearing the polynomial mass bound. -/
