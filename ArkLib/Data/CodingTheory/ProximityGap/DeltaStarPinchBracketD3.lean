# wf-D3 (#444): the over-determined incidence FLOOR vs the KKH26 ceiling — a two-sided
bracket on `δ*`, and the exact gap (NO pinch)

## What this file establishes

The lane question was whether the wf-NH **over-determined incidence floor** meets the
**[KKH26] ceiling** `δ* ≤ 1 − r/2^μ` at the binding radius — a *pinch* (floor = ceiling)
would pin `δ*` exactly and close the prize.

The numerics (`scripts/probes/probe_wf3D3_pinch.py`, exact-integer FarCosetExplosion counts;
cross-checked against the 8×H100 GPU oracle's exact `δ*` up to n=38) settle it:

  | n | ρ=1/4 | floor δ_bind = (n−s*)/n | ceiling 1−(k+1)/n | gap |
  |---|-------|-------------------------|-------------------|-----|
  | 16| k=4   | 0.5625  (s*=7)          | 0.6875            | +0.125 |
  | 32| k=8   | 0.5938  (s*=13, GPU)    | 0.7188            | +0.125 |

The floor (worst far **monomial** direction, which wf-NH proved is the worst direction, and
which matches the GPU's full-direction exact `δ*` verbatim) sits a **constant** `δ`-gap below
the ceiling.  **There is NO pinch**: the gap `(s* − (k+1))/n ≈ 1/8` at ρ=1/4 does *not* shrink
with `n` (two-point fit; conjecture below).  The remaining open quantity is *exactly* this gap.

A crucial correction this lane makes to the bracket bookkeeping: the [KKH26] ceiling `1 − r/2^μ`
is **NOT** free to minimize over `r`.  The bad line lives on the eval code of degree `(r−2)·m`,
so for the thin `n = 2^μ` (m = 1) code of dimension `k` one has `k = r − 2 + 1 = r − 1`, i.e.
**`r = k + 1` is rate-locked**.  (Minimizing `1 − r/2^μ` over all valid `r`, as a naive reading
suggests, gives the spurious `1 − 1/2 = 0.5` that is *below* the exact `δ* = 0.5625` — a
contradiction that flags the error.)  With the rate-locked `r = k+1`, the ceiling
`1 − (k+1)/n` lies strictly above the exact `δ*`, consistent with a genuine bracket.

## What is PROVEN here (axiom-clean)

* `kkh26_ceiling_rate_locked` — the **upper** side, unconditional: for the thin `n = 2^μ` eval
  code of dimension `k = r − 1` (so `r = k+1`), at any `ε*` below the KKH26 spread,
  `mcaDeltaStar ≤ 1 − r/2^μ`.  A thin specialization of `kkh26_mcaDeltaStar_le`.
* `deltaStar_two_sided_bracket` — given a **named** over-det floor good point
  (`OverDetFloorGood`: the radius `δ_bind` is good, `ε_mca ≤ ε*`), the two-sided bracket
  `δ_bind ≤ mcaDeltaStar ≤ 1 − r/2^μ` holds, with the upper side discharged by KKH26.
* `bracket_gap_eq` — the bracket **width is exactly** `(1 − r/2^μ) − δ_bind`; pinch ⟺ this is 0.

## What is NOT proven (honest)

The **lower** side `OverDetFloorGood` is left as a named hypothesis: the wf-NH brick proves the
per-witness `≤ 1` γ subsingleton (so the binding incidence is the p-independent combinatorial
union count), but the translation of "worst-monomial incidence ≤ budget" into the *full*
`ε_mca(C, δ_bind) ≤ ε*` over the whole code is not yet a Lean brick.  So the floor is supplied
as a hypothesis, the ceiling is unconditional, and the **gap is the open residual** — quantified
exactly here, refuting the pinch (status: refuted-as-pinch / bracket-quantified, NOT a closure).

`n = 2^μ` evaluation code of degree `r − 2` (hence dimension `k = r − 1`), at any target error
below the explicit KKH26 bad-scalar spread, the formal MCA threshold is at most `1 − r/2^μ`.
This is the honest upper side of the wf-D3 bracket: `r` is the code's *own* rate parameter, not
a free minimization variable. -/

/-- **The over-determined floor as a named good point** (wf-NH input, not yet a Lean brick).
`δ_bind` is the binding radius `(n − s*)/n`; the hypothesis asserts it is a *good* radius
(`ε_mca ≤ ε*`).  Numerically `δ_bind` equals the GPU oracle's exact `δ*`; the worst-monomial
incidence at `s*` is `≤ budget = q·ε* = n`, and wf-NH proved that incidence is the
p-independent per-witness union count.  Translating that to the full-code `ε_mca` bound is the
open lower-side residual. -/

KKH26 spread, the formal MCA threshold of the thin eval code is bracketed

the named floor.  When `δ_bind < 1 − r/2^μ` (which the numerics confirm: gap ≈ 1/8 at ρ=1/4)
this is a genuine non-degenerate bracket — NOT a pinch. -/

/-- **The bracket gap is exactly `(1 − r/2^μ) − δ_bind`.**  This is the wf-D3 quantification of
the remaining open quantity: the lane's measurements give `(1 − (k+1)/n) − δ_bind ≈ 1/8` at
ρ = 1/4 for `n ∈ {16, 32}` (constant, NOT shrinking), so this gap is strictly positive there —
the floor and ceiling do **not** pinch.  A pinch is the statement `gap = 0`, which the numerics
**refute** in the prize window. -/
