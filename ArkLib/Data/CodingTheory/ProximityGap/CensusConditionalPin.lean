# The census-conditional δ* pin: δ* as the crossing radius of the constrained subset-sum census

The O137/O138/O139 probe arc (issue #357) produced the *corrected extremality conjecture*:
for smooth-domain RS codes, `ε_mca(C, 1 − a/n) · |F|` equals the size of the **constrained
subset-sum census** `{−e₁(A) : A an a-subset of the domain, e₂(A) = ⋯ = e_{a−k}(A) = 0}`,
attained on the twisted-monomial orbit of the adjacent-exponent pair — verified exactly at
every rung where exact computation exists ((5,4,2), (13,4,2), (17,4,2), (12,6)×3 fields), with
the census measured *inside the window* at (16,4) and (8,4) including an empty-census death
radius. If this holds at production scales, the in-window upper bracket of δ* is the
asymptotics of one additive-combinatorics object.

This file welds that programme into the `mcaDeltaStar` ledger:

* `constrainedCensus` — the census, formal (first formalization of the probe object).
* `agreeOf` + `mcaEvent_agree_iff` + `epsMCA_eq_grid` — **the radius-quantization theorem**:
  `ε_mca` depends on `δ` only through the agreement threshold `⌈(1−δ)n⌉`, so it is a step
  function constant between grid radii `1 − a/n`. This retroactively certifies every
  grid-sampled probe and lets grid hypotheses control all radii.
* `CensusUpperExtremal` — the **named open hypothesis** (the conjecture's upper half: above
  the crossing agreement no stack beats the census). The lower half — the census scalars are
  genuinely bad for the explicit monomial stack — is the per-instance provable half
  (`badScalar_iff_subsetSum` / the O138 census law).
* `mcaDeltaStar_eq_of_censusCrossing` — **the conditional pin**: census-upper extremality +
  census numerics (good above the crossing, bad at it) ⟹ `mcaDeltaStar = 1 − a_c/n` exactly.
  "Pin δ*" for these codes is thereby *equivalent, given extremality, to locating the census
  crossing* — a finite, per-scale additive-combinatorics computation.
* `mcaDeltaStar_F5_via_census` — **non-vacuity, end-to-end**: at RS[F₅, F₅*, 2] the census
  route is fully instantiated (census(3) = {1,2,3,4} of size 4 — kernel-checked — crossing
  ε* = 2/5 at a_c = 3; census(4) = {0} matching `ε_mca = 1/5` at δ = 0), recovering
  `δ* = 1/4` purely through the census engine, in agreement with the direct pin
  (`mcaDeltaStar_rs_F5_eq_quarter`). The extremality inputs at this scale are *theorems*,
  not hypotheses.

All results are `sorry`-free and axiom-clean (`[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`).
