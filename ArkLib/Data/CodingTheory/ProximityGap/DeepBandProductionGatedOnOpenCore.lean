# Production deep-band bad-set count is gated solely on the open core (#389)

The boundary-pinning files (`DeepBandProductionSubJohnson`,
`…General`, `…SharpRate`) proved the in-tree above-Johnson discharge provably
inapplicable across the production regime — but those vacuity statements were
standalone arithmetic, consumed nowhere.  This file makes them **load-bearing**:
it wires them into #389's actual conclusion, the deep-band bad-scalar count.

The consumer chain is in-tree and axiom-clean:
`SubJohnsonListBound → ExplainableCoreSupply` (`explainableCoreSupply_of_listBound`)
→ the bad-set count (`deep_band_badSet_card_of_supply`).  The capstone composes
them at `m = 0` and conjoins the sharp-rate vacuity, yielding the precise statement:

> In the first production band (rate `≤ k/(k+4)`), the open core
> `SubJohnsonListBound` **alone** produces the bad-set count
> `C(n,k+1) ≤ #badSet · |F|⁰ · (L·C(A,k+1))`, **and** the in-tree above-Johnson
> route that would otherwise supply this bound is provably unavailable
> (`¬ n(k−1) < (k+1)²`).  So `SubJohnsonListBound` is the *sole* remaining input.

This does **not** close the open core (the sub-Johnson list bound stays the named
open obligation) — it pins, in the actual consumer form, that the open core is the
only gate left in the deployed regime, and that no in-tree route sidesteps it.

Axiom-clean (`propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound`); no `sorry`.
