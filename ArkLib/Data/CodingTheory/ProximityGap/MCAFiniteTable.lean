# The finite-table assembly (#357 round 14): `δ*` from finitely many floor values

The band-pin (`mcaDeltaStar_eq_of_band`) requires badness on a continuum of radii; the
step-function law says `ε_mca` only sees the agreement floor. This file welds them:

* **`mcaDeltaStar_eq_of_finite_floor_table`** — `δ* = δ₀` follows from (i) goodness at
  `δ₀`, (ii) badness at a **finite table** `T` of canonical radii, and (iii) a coverage
  condition (every radius beyond `δ₀` shares its floor with a table entry). The
  continuum collapses to `≤ n + 1` checks.

This is the final reduction of the production assembly: for any code and any `ε*`,
`δ*(ε*)` is pinned by finitely many floor-value determinations
`V_t = ε_mca(canonical radius of floor t)` — each of which the campaign's census
machinery (LYM ceiling + supply + the four-family circuit census + the slope
optimization) addresses per cell. The remaining mathematical content of `δ*` at
production scale lives entirely in those finitely many `V_t` values; the assembly
around them is **complete and proven**.

Axiom-clean (`propext`, `Classical.choice`, `Quot.sound`); no `sorry`.
